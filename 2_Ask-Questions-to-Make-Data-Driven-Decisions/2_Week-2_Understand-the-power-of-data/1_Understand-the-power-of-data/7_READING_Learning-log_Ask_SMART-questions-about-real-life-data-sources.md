# Learning Log: Ask SMART questions about real-life data sources

## Overview

In a [previous self-reflection](../1_Week-1_Effective-Questions/4_Craft-effective-questions/5_PRACTICE-QUIZ_Self-reflection_Ask-your-own-SMART-questions.md), you prepared for a “data conversation” with someone in your life by creating SMART questions to help you understand more about the data they usually interact with, the limitations of the data they have, and their business goals. Now, you’ll complete an entry in your learning log to reflect on that conversation and how you might approach this data for a real project. By the time you complete this log entry, you will have a stronger understanding of how to use the SMART framework to craft effective questions about real life data. This will be a key skill as you begin to develop your own data analysis projects.

## Review your notes

Before you begin your new entry, take a moment to locate and read the notes you took during your data conversation. Based on the answers to your well-prepared SMART questions, you should have a better context for your target audience now. Review those answers and start thinking about the following:

- Stakeholder’s business goals; in this case, the person you had a conversation with
- Identifying the data needed to answer the SMART questions
- Exploring what data the stakeholder already has
- Determining the data that you don’t have, but need in order to answer the questions

You’ll reflect on how your data conversation went and what you learned in your learning log template which is linked below.

## Reflection

Write 5-7 sentences (100-140 words) about data sources discussed during your real-life data conversation.

First, consider your data conversation and how it went. Here are some questions to help you get started:

- Was there anything challenging about getting the conversation started?
- Were there questions you didn’t get to ask?
- Did you manage your time effectively?
- Did you take notes? Are they as detailed as you need them to be?
- Are you missing any information? Is there anything that you still find unclear or vague?  
- If you could do the conversation over again, is there anything you would change?

Next, turn your attention to your notes and reflect on what you know about the data itself:

- What are the sources of data available for the project?
- Which data sources were qualitative and which were quantitative? Explain your answer.
- What decisions could you make when considering each data source separately? Could you make different decisions about the data if you combined it? If so, give an example.
- Is there any kind of data that isn’t available, but you would like to find? If so, what is it, and why would you like to know more about it?

When you’ve finished your entry in the learning log template, make sure to save the document so your response is somewhere accessible. This will help you continue applying data analysis to your everyday life. You will also be able to track your progress and growth as a data analyst.

## My Response

### My self-review

- Stakeholder’s Business Goals:
  - Luu Quang Linh, working in the Marketing field for Bao Ngoc Investment Production Corporation, discussed their business goals related to the Mid-autumn festival campaign.
  - Their primary goal is to increase sales and brand visibility during this festive season.
  - They aim to engage with existing customers and attract new ones through effective marketing strategies.
- Identifying the Data Needed:
  - The data needed to answer the SMART questions included:
    - Sales data for tracking revenue and growth.
    - Customer engagement metrics to assess the effectiveness of marketing efforts.
    - Conversion rates to measure the success of specific campaigns.
    - Historical marketing performance data for analysis and decision-making.
    - Data related to competitors and market trends to stay competitive.
- Exploring Existing Data:
  - Bao Ngoc already has historical sales data, customer databases, and past campaign performance data.
  - They also collect data on customer feedback and preferences through surveys and feedback forms.
  - They utilize social media analytics tools to monitor engagement and track customer sentiments.
- Determining Missing Data:
  - While they have valuable historical data, there might be a need for more detailed customer segmentation data to personalize marketing efforts.
  - Real-time market trend data could be beneficial for more proactive decision-making.
  - Data related to competitors' strategies and market benchmarks could provide valuable insights.

In summary, the review of the conversation with Luu Quang Linh reveals that Bao Ngoc Investment Production Corporation's business goals are centered around increasing sales and enhancing their brand image during the Mid-autumn festival campaign. They have existing data sources related to sales, customer engagement, and past campaigns, but there is potential value in acquiring more detailed customer segmentation data, real-time market trend data, and competitor-related data to further optimize their marketing strategies.

### My reflection

During my conversation with Luu Quang Linh, initiating the dialogue was fairly smooth, given our shared interest in data-driven marketing. However, I found it challenging to prioritize my SMART questions effectively within the allotted time, which resulted in some questions remaining unasked.

While I did take notes during our conversation, they could have been more detailed, especially regarding specific data sources. Some nuances about the data and its sources could have been captured more comprehensively.

Bao Ngoc Investment Production Corporation primarily relies on internal data sources, such as sales records, customer databases, and historical campaign performance data, containing quantitative data. They also collect qualitative data from customer feedback surveys and social media analytics tools. Combining these data sources could inform more robust decision-making. For instance, analyzing quantitative sales data alongside qualitative feedback could reveal trends and areas for improvement.

However, our conversation highlighted the absence of real-time market trend and competitor-related data. Acquiring these data types would enhance their competitiveness and adaptability. If I could redo the conversation, I would allocate more time for in-depth discussions about specific data sources and their potential integration to improve decision-making capabilities.

### Get started questions

1. Was there anything challenging about getting the conversation started?
The initial conversation with Luu Quang Linh wasn't particularly challenging, as we both share an interest in data-driven marketing. However, focusing the discussion on specific aspects of data analysis required some effort to ensure we stayed on track.
2. Were there questions you didn’t get to ask?
Yes, due to time constraints, I couldn't ask all the questions I had prepared. Some questions related to data sources and specific metrics had to be skipped.
3. Did you manage your time effectively?
Managing time effectively was a bit challenging. While I had a list of SMART questions prepared, it was essential to gauge the conversation's flow and adapt accordingly. Some questions required more in-depth discussions, which impacted the overall timing.
4. Did you take notes? Are they as detailed as you need them to be?
I did take notes during our conversation, but in hindsight, they could have been more detailed. There were specific data source details and nuances that I missed capturing, which would have been valuable for future reference.
5. Are you missing any information? Is there anything that you still find unclear or vague?
Based on our conversation, I have a clearer understanding of their data sources and goals. However, there is room for more clarity regarding their data collection processes and the specific qualitative data they gather.
6. If you could do the conversation over again, is there anything you would change?
If given the opportunity for a do-over, I would allocate more time for in-depth discussions about specific data sources, especially their qualitative data collection methods. Additionally, I would ensure all my prepared questions were addressed to gather a more comprehensive picture of their data-driven marketing efforts.

### Reflection on what I know about the Data itself

1. What are the sources of data available for the project?
During the conversation with Luu Quang Linh, I learned that the primary sources of data for their Mid-autumn festival campaign include customer surveys and feedback forms submitted through their website and social media platforms. They also collect sales data from their online store and physical retail locations. These sources provide both qualitative and quantitative data.
2. Which data sources were qualitative and which were quantitative? Explain your answer.
Customer surveys and feedback forms are qualitative data sources because they capture subjective opinions, sentiments, and open-text responses. In contrast, sales data, including sales figures, customer counts, and transaction amounts, is quantitative because it involves numerical measurements.
3. What decisions could you make when considering each data source separately? Could you make different decisions about the data if you combined it? If so, give an example.

- When considering each data source separately, we can make the following decisions:
  - Qualitative Data (Surveys and Feedback): This data can help identify customer preferences, pain points, and areas for improvement. Decisions might include adjusting marketing strategies, product offerings, or customer service processes based on feedback.
  - Quantitative Data (Sales Data): This data provides insights into revenue trends, popular products, and sales channel effectiveness. Decisions may involve optimizing inventory, pricing strategies, or allocation of marketing budgets.

Combining both data sources could lead to more informed decisions. For instance, if qualitative data reveals that customers express frustration about product availability during the festival, and quantitative data shows declining sales during specific timeframes, the company can correlate this information to ensure they stock enough of the in-demand products during peak festival periods.
4. Is there any kind of data that isn’t available, but you would like to find? If so, what is it, and why would you like to know more about it?

One type of data that wasn't explicitly mentioned during our conversation is competitor data. It would be valuable to know more about competitors' marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer satisfaction levels. Understanding the competitive landscape can help in benchmarking and making strategic decisions to stay ahead in the market.
