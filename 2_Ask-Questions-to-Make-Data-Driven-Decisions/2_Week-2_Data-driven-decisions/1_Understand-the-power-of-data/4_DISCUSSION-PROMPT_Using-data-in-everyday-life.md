# Using data in everyday life

The average adult makes thousands of conscious decisions each day. Think about how many of those are data-driven decisions, such as the ones you’ve been learning about. Data surrounds your everyday activities. The daily weather report contains data, and so does a sign listing your local convenience store’s hours. If you think about it, you base your decisions on available data all the time, whether you're checking the weather report to decide what to wear or looking up store hours to know what time to shop.

For each task listed below, what data is available to help make decisions related to the task? For example, item prices are pieces of data available for deciding how to spend money.

- When to wake up
- Whether to go out to eat
- What to spend money on
- What to listen to on the radio
- Who to call on the phone

For this discussion prompt, first come up with three data sources for each of the five tasks. Then, in a post of two or more paragraphs (100-200 words), describe the data sources for two of the tasks. Finally, visit the [discussion forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ask-questions-make-decisions/discussions) to read what other learners have written, and engage in discussion with at least two posts.

**Focus on 2 of the tasks:**

My three datasources for two of the tasks:

- When to wake up:
  - Alarm Clock or Smartphone: Many people use alarm clocks or smartphone apps to set specific wake-up times based on their daily schedules. This device or app provides the time data for when to wake up.
  - Sleep Tracking Devices: Some individuals use sleep tracking devices, such as smartwatches, to monitor their sleep cycles and identify optimal wake-up times based on their sleep quality.
  - Weather Forecast: Knowing the sunrise time and weather conditions can influence wake-up decisions. A weather app or website provides data on sunrise times and weather forecasts.
- Whether to go out to eat:
  - Restaurant Reviews and Ratings: Online platforms like Google Map, Yelp or TripAdvisor offer reviews, ratings, and feedback from previous customers. These reviews provide data on the quality of food and service, helping individuals decide whether to dine out.
  - Personal Budgeting Apps: Financial data and budgeting apps can track an individual's monthly expenses, including dining expenses. Analyzing this data can help individuals decide whether dining out fits their budget.
  - Local Events Calendar: Some people prefer to eat out when there are local events or promotions. Local event calendars or websites provide data on upcoming events, allowing individuals to plan dining outings accordingly.

> These data sources empower individuals to make data-driven decisions regarding when to wake up and whether to go out to eat. Data plays a significant role in everyday choices, providing valuable information for informed decision-making.
