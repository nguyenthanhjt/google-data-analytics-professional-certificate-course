Now that you're done,
you're officially ready to take on the next course. Awesome job. But before I tell you
about what's ahead, let's take a moment to think
about what we've covered so far in the first step of
the data analysis process. In this course, we explored
effective questions and we learned how to use quantitative and
qualitative data, metrics and math to
connect the dots. We also covered
spreadsheet basics, how to apply structured thinking and key communication skills for working with stakeholders and
team members. That's a lot! Now it's time to take what you learned into the next course, where you'll tackle
the next step of the data analysis process,
prepare your data. Hallie is going to
take over from here. You might remember her from the beginning of
the first course! She'll guide you as you
learn new important tools for your work, like data
types and data structures; bias and credibility
in analytics; databases; organizing and
protecting your data; and the data community. Thanks for sticking with
me through this course. When you're ready, you can go ahead to the first video
in the next course. Good luck. You're
going to do great.
