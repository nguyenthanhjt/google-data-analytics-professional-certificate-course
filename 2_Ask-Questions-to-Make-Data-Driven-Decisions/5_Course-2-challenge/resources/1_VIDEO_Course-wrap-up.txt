Congrats, you've made it through another course. And you
know what that means? It's time for the
course challenge. You'll take everything
you've learned in this course and apply it in
these upcoming activities. As always, feel free to
review any of the work we did to refresh your
memory before the challenge. Once you've finished,
we'll meet back here to find out what's
coming in the next course. Good luck. You got this.
