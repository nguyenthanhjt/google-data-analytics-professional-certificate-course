# Course 2 challenge

## 1.Scenario 1, questions 1-5

You’ve just started a job as a data analyst at a small software company that provides data analytics and business intelligence solutions. Your supervisor asks you to kick off a project with a new client, Athena’s Story, a feminist bookstore. They have four existing locations, and the fifth shop has just opened in your community.

Athena’s Story wants to produce a campaign to generate excitement for an upcoming celebration and introduce the bookstore to the community. They share some data with your team to help make the event as successful as possible.

Your task is to review the assignment and the available data, then present your approach to your supervisor. Click the link below to access the email from your supervisor: [Course-2-Scenario-1-Email-from-Supervisor.pdf](./resources/Course-2-Scenario-1-Email-from-Supervisor.pdf)

Good afternoon!
See below for an exciting opportunity from our newest client, Athena’s Story, a feminist
bookstore that just opened in our city. They’re looking for us to help them make their March
campaign a success. I know you’ll do a great job supporting the launch of their new bookstore.
Looking forward to hearing how you might tackle this challenge -- please reach out with any
questions.

Hello, Rosa:
Thanks for the call yesterday! We’re looking forward to partnering with you on our upcoming
WHM campaign. We’ve been excited to open our newest location in your community and are
hoping that you can help us make this campaign a success.
We’ve gathered results from a recent customer survey. The survey includes data about whether
people plan to celebrate WHM. It also asks if they might celebrate by purchasing feminist books
as a gift for a friend or just to enjoy themselves. And we surveyed customers to find out what
they like most about Athena's Story and what types of books they’d like us to carry in the future.
We also have a dataset of historical data of internal sales records from our other four stores.
We’ve included information on our two most profitable genres: feminist fiction and biographies of
inspiring women. And we’ve included information on two new genres: children’s literature and
feminist zines. We’ve only started carrying children’s literature and feminist zines in the past 12
months, but our customer survey does seem to indicate that people would enjoy seeing more of
these kinds of titles.
As you know, we don’t have our own analytics or insights team, so we’re hoping you can help us
make sense of it all. Let us know if we can answer any questions for you or your analytics team.
Thanks!
Emmeline, on behalf of Athena’s Story

Then, review the email, and the Customer Survey and Historical Sales datasets.
To use the templates for the datasets, click the links below and select “Use Template.”

OR
If you don't have a Google account, you can download the CSV files directly from the attachments: [CustomerSurvey.csv](./resources/CustomerSurvey.csv) and [HistoricalSales.csv](./resources/HistoricalSales.csv)

After reading the email, you notice that the acronym WHM appears in multiple places. You look it up online, and the most common result is web host manager. That doesn’t seem right to you, as it doesn’t fit the context of a feminist bookstore. You email your supervisor to ask. **When writing your email, what do you do to ensure it sounds professional? Select all that apply.**

- `Use a polite greeting and closing.`
- `Read your email aloud before sending to catch any typos or grammatical errors and to ensure the communication is clear.`
- `Respect your supervisor’s time by writing an email that’s short and to the point.`
- Write a clear subject line that gets a fast response so you can keep working: “WHM? NEED TO KNOW WHAT THAT IS RIGHT AWAY.”

## 2. Scenario 1 continued

Now that you know WHM stands for Women’s History Month, you continue reviewing the datasets. You notice that the Customer Survey dataset contains both qualitative and quantitative data.

To use the template for the dataset, click the link below and select “Use Template.”
Link to template: [Customer Survey]
OR If you don't have a Google account, you can download the CSV file directly from the attachment .

The quantitative data includes information from which columns? Select all that apply.

- `Column C (Survey Q3: Do you purchase feminist books in honor of WHM, either for yourself or as a gift for someone else?)`
- `Column A (Survey Q1: Do you plan to celebrate WHM?)`
- `Column D (Survey Q4: If answered "Yes" to Q3, how many books do you typically purchase during March?)`
- Column E (Survey Q5: What do you like most about Athena's Story?)

## 3. Scenario 1 continued

Next, you review the customer feedback in column F of the [Customer Survey] dataset.
To use the template for the dataset, click the link below and select “Use Template.”
Link to template: [Customer Survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HbBfNTuHCmQyY0GJrsdj6OCOkmeA5sUAQ-jXx8bMdpY/template/preview)
OR If you don't have a Google account, you can download the CSV file directly from the attachment [CustomerSurvey.csv](./resources/CustomerSurvey.csv)

The attribute of column F is, “Survey Q6: What types of books would you like to see more of at Athena's Story?” In order to verify that children’s literature and feminist zines are among the most popular genres, you create a visualization. This will help you clearly identify which genres are most likely to sell well during the Women’s History Month campaign.
Your visualization looks like this:
![x](./resources/img-1.png)

- **Pie chart categories:**
  - Feminist science fiction 4.8%
  - Books about women 2.4%
  - Women's journals 2.4%
  - Feminist literary criticism 2.4%
  - Children's literature 15.5%
  - Women's history books 2.4%
  - Biographies of inspiration 20.2%
  - Feminist fiction 26.2%
  - Feminist zines 14.3%
  - Feminist poetry 4.6%
  - Feminist novels 3.6%

- What is a pie chart effective for demonstrating?
  - Trends over time
  - Where things are located on a map
  - Relationships between variables
  - `Percentages that make up a whole`

## 4. Question 4: Now that you’ve confirmed that children’s literature and feminist zines are among the most requested book genres, you review the Historical Sales dataset

To use the template for the dataset, click the link below and select “Use Template.”
Link to template: [Historical Sales](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/ta9P5mnbRZevT-Zp2wWXMw_dbd2edcd01804aa49f17fef80cc70f95_HistoricalSales---HistoricalSales.csv?Expires=1701475200&Signature=GUib9qnhD1s5FE4CyyJWNH53W-6xOkkrZkuIXz2QwB2F3YCeFJ6RxTnq7tTgV3w-9DsU3JpqXj8k~-0zBqQj8j2Wh7UgN4D6VD6jdVPJKMKEwpLP50~HfdBIgBNmAFEpoRwoM5qskFdZtyq5SUmek-Ub0RajePNNkDYqBGV3m2s_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)
OR If you don't have a Google account, you can download the CSV file directly from the attachment [HistoricalSales.csv](./resources/HistoricalSales.csv).

You’re pleased to see that the dataset contains data that’s specific to children’s literature and feminist zines. This will provide you with the information you need to make data-inspired decisions. In addition, the children’s literature and feminist zines metrics will help you organize and analyze the data about each genre in order to determine if they’re likely to be profitable.

Next, you calculate the total sales over 52 weeks for children’s literature. What is the correct syntax?

- =MAX(D2:D53)
- `=SUM(D2:D53)`
- =COUNT(D2:D53)
- =CALCULATE(D2:D53)

## 5. Scenario 1 continued

After familiarizing yourself with the project and available data, you present your approach to your supervisor. You provide a scope of work, which includes important details, a schedule, and information on how you plan to prepare and validate the data. You also share some of your initial results and the pie chart you created.

In addition, you identify the problem type, or domain, for the data analysis project. You decide that the historical sales data can be used to provide insights into the types of books that will sell best during Women’s History Month this coming year. This will also enable you to determine if Athena’s Story should begin selling more children’s literature and feminist zines.

**Using historical data to make informed decisions about how things may be in the future is an example of spotting something unusual.**

- True
- `False`

You arrive Thursday at 1:45 p.m. for your 2:00 p.m. interview. Soon, you’re taken into the office of Mila Aronowicz, vice president of data and strategy. After welcoming you, she begins the behavioral interview.

  - Chief executive officer
  - `Director, data analytics`
  - `Vice president, data and strategy`

**You’re working with a dataset that the data analytics coordinator should have cleaned, but it turns out that it wasn’t. Your supervisor thought the dataset was ready for use, but you discover nulls, redundant data, and other issues. The project is due in less than two weeks. How would you handle that situation?**

- Email your supervisor to let them know the associate data analyst did not complete their assigned task.
- `Communicate with the data analytics coordinator about the issue and offer to work together to clean the data so the project doesn’t fall behind.`
- Call a formal meeting with the data analytics team to solve the problem. Do not invite the associate data analyst, as they clearly don’t have time to help.
