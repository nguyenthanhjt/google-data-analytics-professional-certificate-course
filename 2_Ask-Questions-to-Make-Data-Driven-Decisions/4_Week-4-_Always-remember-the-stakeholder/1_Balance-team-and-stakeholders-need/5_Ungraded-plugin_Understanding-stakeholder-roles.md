- Data analytics team: The data analysts on Ning’s team each have a dataset that they focus on and can help pull the various types of data that Ning needs to satisfy the other stakeholders. Ning collaborates with them to complete the report.
- Data science managers: The data science managers oversee all of the company’s datasets and can help Ning prioritize the types of data and analyses required for the annual report. They can also advise on making an effective presentation.
