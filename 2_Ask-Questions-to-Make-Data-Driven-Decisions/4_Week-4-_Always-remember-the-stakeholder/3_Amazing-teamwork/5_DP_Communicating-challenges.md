## My response

- As a Software Engineer, I prioritize open and transparent communication when addressing challenges. I believe in proactively sharing any roadblocks or technical hurdles with my team. Using clear and concise language, I outline the specific issues and propose potential solutions or alternative approaches. This not only keeps everyone informed but also invites collaborative problem-solving. Additionally, I leverage project management tools to document challenges and solutions, ensuring visibility and traceability. This approach fosters a culture of teamwork and allows for timely adjustments, ultimately contributing to the overall success of the project.
