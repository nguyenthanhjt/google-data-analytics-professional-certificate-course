# Test your knowledge on teamwork

## Question 1: Your supervisor gives you a new data analysis project with unclear instructions, and you become frustrated trying to figure out how to proceed. Which actions can you take next that demonstrate a responsibility to move the project forward? Select all that apply

- Send your supervisor an email letting them know they did not explain the project well.
- Find your supervisor in person so they can clearly observe how frustrated you are.
- `Schedule a time to ask your supervisor more questions about the big picture goals.`
- `Do some additional research to better understand the context of the request.`

## Question 2: You’re working on a data analysis project with a coworker, and the two of you disagree on what the data is telling you. Things get tense. The best course of action is to go to your supervisor and politely explain that your coworker is looking at the data incorrectly. Then, ask to work with a different coworker on future projects

- True
- `False`

## Question 3: A director emails you asking for a report by the end of the week. This type of report takes at least 10 days to complete correctly. What is the best course of action?

- Forward the email to another data analyst on your team, and ask them to do the report instead. It’ll still be late, but at least it won’t reflect poorly on you.
- Call the director, and let them know there’s no way anyone could possibly meet that deadline.
- Complete the report as best you can by the end of the week so you meet the requested deadline.
- `Email the director and say that you would be happy to do that, but you believe it will take 10 days to get the information you need. Then, ask if you can discuss the possibility of a different timeline`
