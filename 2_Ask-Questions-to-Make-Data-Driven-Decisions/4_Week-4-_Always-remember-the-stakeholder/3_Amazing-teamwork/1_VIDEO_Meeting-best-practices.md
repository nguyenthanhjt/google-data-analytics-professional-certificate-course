- Now it's time to discuss meetings.
- Meetings are a huge part of how you communicate with team members and stakeholders.
- Let's cover some easy-to-follow do's and don'ts, you can use for meetings both in person or online so that you can use these communication best practices in the future.
- At their core, meetings make it possible for you and your team members or stakeholders to discuss how a project is going.
- But they can be so much more than that.
- Whether they're virtual or in person, team meetings can build trust and team spirit.
- They give you a chance to connect with the people you're working with beyond emails.
- Another benefit is that knowing who you're working with can give you a better perspective of where your work fits into the larger project.
- Regular meetings also make it easier to coordinate team goals, which makes it easier to reach your objectives.
- With everyone on the same page, your team will be in the best position to help each other when you run into problems too.
- Whether you're leading a meeting or just attending it, there are best practices you can follow to make sure your meetings are a success.
- There are some really simple things you can do to make a great meeting:
  - Come prepared,
  - Be on time,
  - Pay attention, and
  - Ask questions.
- This applies to both meetings you lead and ones you attend.
- Let's break down how you can follow these to-dos for every meeting.
- What do I mean when I say come prepared? Well, a few things.
- First, bring what you need.
- If you like to take notes, have your notebook and pens in your bag or your work device on hand.
- Being prepared also means you should read the meeting agenda ahead of time and be ready to provide any updates on your work.
- If you're leading the meeting, make sure to prepare your notes and presentations and know what you're going to talk about and of course, be ready to answer questions.
- These are some other tips that I like to follow when I'm leading a meeting.
  - First, every meeting should focus on making a clear decision and include the person needed to make that decision.
  - And if there needs to be a meeting in order to make a decision, schedule it immediately.
  - Don't let progress stall by waiting until next week's meeting.
  - Lastly, try to keep the number of people at your meeting under 10 if possible. More people makes it hard to have a collaborative discussion.
  - It's also important to respect your team members' time.
  - The best way to do this is to come to meetings on time.
  - If you're leading the meeting, show up early and set up beforehand so you're ready to start when people arrive. You can do the same thing for online meetings.
  - Try to make sure your technology is working beforehand and that you're watching the clock so you don't miss a meeting accidentally.
  - Staying focused and attentive during a meeting is another great way to respect your team members' time.
  - You don't want to miss something important because you were distracted by something else during a presentation.
  - Paying attention also means asking questions when you need clarification, or if you think there may be a problem with a project plan.
  - Don't be afraid to reach out after a meeting.
- If you didn't get to ask your question, follow up with the group afterwards and get your answer.
- When you're the person leading the meeting, make sure you build and send out an agenda beforehand, so your team members can come prepared and leave with clear takeaways.
- You'll also want to keep everyone involved.
- Try to engage with all your attendees so you don't miss out on any insights from your team members.
- Let everyone know that you're open to questions after the meeting too.
- It's a great idea to take notes even when you're leading the meeting.
- This makes it easier to remember all questions that were asked.
- Then afterwards you can follow up with individual team members to answer those questions or send an update to your whole team depending on who needs that information.
- Now let's go over what not to do in meetings.
- There are some obvious "don'ts" here.
- You don't want to show up unprepared, late, or distracted for meetings.
- You also don't want to dominate the conversation, talk over others, or distract people with unfocused discussion.
- Try to make sure you give other team members a chance to talk and always let them finish their thought before you start speaking.
- Everyone who is attending your meeting should be giving their input.
- Provide opportunities for people to speak up, ask questions, call for expertise, and solicit their feedback.
- You don't want to miss out on their valuable insights.
- And try to have everyone put their phones or computers on silent when they're not speaking, you included.
- Now we've learned some best practices you can follow in meetings like come prepared, be on time, pay attention, and ask questions.
- We also talked about using meetings productively to make clear decisions and promoting collaborative discussions and to reach out after a meeting to address questions you or others might have had.
- You also know what not to do in meetings: showing up unprepared, late, or distracted, or talking over others and missing out on their input.
- With these tips in mind, you'll be well on your way to productive, positive team meetings.
- But of course, sometimes there will be conflict in your team.
- We'll discuss conflict resolution soon.
