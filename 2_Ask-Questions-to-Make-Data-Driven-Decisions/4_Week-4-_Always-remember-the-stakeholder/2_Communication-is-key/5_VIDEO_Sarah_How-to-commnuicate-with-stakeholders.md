- I'm Sarah and I'm a senior analytical leader at Google.
- As a data analyst, there's going to be times where you have different stakeholders who have no idea about the amount of time that it takes you to do each project, and in the very beginning when I'm asked to do a project or to look into something, I always try to give a little bit of expectation settings on the turn around because most of your stakeholders don't really understand what you do with data and how you get it and how you clean it and put together the story behind it.
- The other thing that I want to make clear to everyone is that you have to make sure that the data tells you the stories.
- Sometimes people think that data can answer everything and sometimes we have to acknowledge that that is simply untrue.
- I recently worked with a state to figure out why people weren't signing up for the benefits that they needed and deserved.
- We saw people coming to the site and where they would sign up for those benefits and see if they're qualified.
- But for some reason there was something stopping them from taking the step of actually signing up.
- So I was able to look into it using Google Analytics to try to uncover what is stopping people from taking the action of signing up for these benefits that they need and deserve.
- And so I go into Google Analytics, I see people are going back between this service page and the unemployment page back to the service page, back to the unemployment page.
- And so I came up with a theory that hey, people aren't finding the information that they need in order to take the next step to see if they qualify for these services.
- The only way that I can actually know why someone left the site without taking action is if I ask them.
- I would have to survey them.
- Google Analytics did not give me the data that I would need to 100% back my theory or deny it.
- So when you're explaining to your stakeholders, "Hey I have a theory.
- This data is telling me a story.
- However I can't 100% know due to the limitations of data," You just have to say it.
- So the way that I communicate that is I say "I have a theory that people are not finding the information that they need in order to take action.
- Here's the proved points that I have that support that theory." So what we did was we then made it a little bit easier to find that information.
- Even though we weren't 100% sure that my theory was correct, we were confident enough to take action and then we looked back, and we saw all the metrics that pointed me to this theory improve.
- And so that always feels really good when you're able to help a cause that you believe in do better, and help more people through data.
- It makes all the nerdy learning about SQL and everything completely worth it.

## Keypoints

- Setting Expectations:
  - Sarah emphasizes the importance of setting expectations with stakeholders regarding the time required - for data analysis projects.
  - Acknowledges that stakeholders may not fully understand the complexities of working with data, and - it's crucial to provide insights into the data analysis process.
- Understanding the Limitations of Data:
  - Sarah highlights that data cannot answer every question, and it's essential to acknowledge the - limitations of data.
  - Shares a real-life example of working on a project to understand why people weren't signing up for - benefits, illustrating the need to recognize when data may not provide a complete answer.
- Interpreting Data Stories:
  - Describes the process of using Google Analytics to uncover insights about user behavior on a website.
  - Emphasizes that data tells a story, but analysts must interpret and communicate that story - effectively to stakeholders.
- Theory and Data Limitations:
  - Discusses how she formulated a theory based on the data but acknowledges the limitations in Google - Analytics in providing a complete picture.
  - Stresses the importance of communicating theories to stakeholders and being transparent about data - limitations.
- Communication Approach:
  - Shares her communication approach by stating her theory, presenting supporting data points, and - clearly expressing the uncertainty due to data limitations.
- Taking Action:
  - Despite not having 100% certainty, Sarah explains how they took action based on the theory, making it - easier for users to find information.
  - Highlights the satisfaction of seeing improvements in metrics after taking action and the positive - impact on the cause.
- Reward of Data-Driven Impact:
  - Conveys the rewarding aspect of using data to contribute to a cause, even when uncertainties exist.
  - Expresses the fulfillment derived from leveraging data skills to make a positive difference.
Sarah's insights provide a valuable perspective on the nuanced nature of data analysis, the importance of clear communication about data limitations, and the impact of data-driven actions on real-world scenarios.
