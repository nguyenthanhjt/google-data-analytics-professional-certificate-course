Hi, I'm Anmol. I'm the Head of Large
Advertiser Marketing Analytics within the Marketing
Team at Google. At its core, my job
is about connecting the right user with the right
message at the right time. The first step is really to get a broad sense of the certain
pattern that's occurring. So for example, we know that
this particular segment of users is more responsive
to this type of content. Once we're able to actually see this hypothesis through the data, we do testing to ensure that the hypothesis
is actually correct. So for example, we would test sending these pieces of content
to this segment of users, and actually verify within
a controlled environment whether that response rate is actually higher for
that type of content, or whether it isn't. Once we're able to actually
verify that hypothesis, we go back to the stakeholders, in this case, our
marketers, and say, we've proven within a relatively
high degree of certainty that this particular
segment is more responsive to this type of
content, and because of that, we're recommending that you produce more of this
type of content. Our stakeholders
really get to see the whole evolution from
hypothesis to proven concept, and they're able to come with us on the journey
on how we're proving out these hypotheses and then
eventually turning them into strategies and
recommendations for the business. The outcome in this
case was that we were able to actually change the way our whole marketing team worked to actually make it
much more user-centric. Instead of, from our perspective, coming up with content that
we think the users need, we're actually going in
the other direction of figuring out what
users need first, proving that they need certain things or they
don't need certain things, and then using that information
going back to marketers and coming up with content
that fulfills their need. So it really changed
the direction of how we produce things.
