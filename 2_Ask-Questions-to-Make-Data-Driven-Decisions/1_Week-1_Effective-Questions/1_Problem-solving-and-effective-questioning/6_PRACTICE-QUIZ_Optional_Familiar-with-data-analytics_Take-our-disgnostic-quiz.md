# Optional: Familiar with data analytics? Take our diagnostic quiz

## 1. Optional: speed track for those experienced in data analytics

The Google Data Analytics Certificate provides instruction and feedback for learners hoping to earn a position as an entry-level data analyst. While many learners will be brand new to the world of data analytics, others may be familiar with the field and simply wanting to brush up on certain skills.

If you believe this course will be primarily a refresher for you, we recommend taking this practice diagnostic quiz. It will enable you to determine if you should follow the speed track, which is an opportunity to proceed to Course 3 after taking each of the Course 2 Weekly Challenges and the overall Course Challenge. Learners who earn 100% on the diagnostic quiz can treat Course 2 videos, readings, and activities as optional. Learners following the speed track are still able to earn the certificate.

Get ready to take the next step in your data analytics journey with the question below!

Categorizing things is one of the six problem types data analysts solve. This type of problem might involve which of the following actions?

- Analyzing how one action leads to or affects another
- Classifying or grouping items
- Using data to envision how something might happen in the future
- Noticing something outside of the ordinary

`Classifying or grouping items`
This answer suggests that you understand that categorizing or grouping items is one of the actions involved in solving the categorization problem type. Since you've correctly answered this question, it indicates that you may have prior knowledge in data analytics, which could make the speed track a suitable option for you.

Feel free to continue with the quiz and complete it to get a comprehensive assessment of your familiarity with data analytics. Based on your overall score and the scoring guide provided, you can make an informed decision about whether to pursue the speed track or follow the regular course path. If you have more questions or need further assistance, please let me know!

## 2. Finding patterns is one of the six problem types data analysts aim to solve. This type of problem might involve which of the following?

- Identifying trends from historical data
- Taking categorized items and grouping them into broader topic areas
- Noticing something outside of the ordinary
- Analyzing how one action leads to or affects another

`Identifying trends from historical data`
Your answer is correct. Identifying trends from historical data is indeed one of the actions involved in solving the problem type of finding patterns. This indicates a good understanding of data analysis concepts.

## 3. In the SMART methodology, questions that encourage change are described how?

- Specific
- Relevant
- Action-oriented
- Time-bound

Action-oriented
Your answer is correct. In the SMART methodology, questions that encourage change are described as "Action-oriented." This indicates a good understanding of the SMART framework used in data analysis.

## 4. Fill in the blank: In data analytics, qualitative data _____. Select all that apply

- is subjective
- measure qualities and characteristic
- is specific
- measures numberical facts

## 5. In data analytics, how are dashboards different from reports?

- Dashboards provide a high level look at historical data. Reports provide a more detailed look at live, interactive data.
- Dashboards contain static data. Reports contain data that is constantly changing.
- Dashboards monitor live, incoming data from multiple datasets and organize the information into one central location. Reports are static collections of data.
- Dashboards are used to share updates with stakeholders only periodically. Reports give stakeholders continuous access to data.

`C. Dashboards monitor live, incoming data from multiple datasets and organize the information into one central location. Reports are static collections of data.`

Dashboards are designed to provide real-time monitoring and visualization of data from various sources, while reports typically present static data in a structured format. Dashboards are dynamic and can update in real-time, making them suitable for tracking live data and organizing it for quick decision-making. Reports, on the other hand, are often generated periodically to provide a summary of historical data but do not update continuously.

## 6. Small data differs from big data in what ways? Select all that apply

A. Small data is typically stored in a database. Big data is typically stored in a spreadsheet.
B. Small data focuses on short, well-defined time periods. Big data focuses on change over a long period of time.
C. Small data involves datasets concerned with a small number of specific metrics. Big data involves datasets that are larger and less specific.
D. Small data is effective for analyzing day-to-day decisions. Big data is effective for analyzing more substantial decisions.

`B, C, D are correct`

Explanation:

- Small data typically deals with smaller, well-defined datasets, making it easier to manage and analyze. In contrast, big data involves larger and more complex datasets that may not fit into traditional databases or spreadsheets.
- Small data often focuses on specific, limited metrics or variables relevant to a particular problem or decision. Big data encompasses a broader range of data, including unstructured and less specific information.
- Small data is well-suited for day-to-day decision-making because of its manageable size and focus on specific, immediate concerns. Big data is often used for more substantial, long-term analyses due to its volume and potential for discovering trends over extended periods.

## 7. Fill in the blank: Some of the most common symbols used in formulas include + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), and / (division). These are called _____

A. references
`B. operators`
C. counts
D. domains

## 8 In the function =SUM(G1:G35), identify the range

A. =SUM(G1)
B. =SUM
C. G35
`D. G1:G35`

## 9. To address a vague, complex problem, a data analyst breaks it down into smaller steps. They use a process to help them recognize the current problem or situation, organize available information, reveal gaps and opportunities, and identify options. What does this scenario describe?

`A. Structured thinking`
B. Analytical thinking
C. Gap analysis
D. Data-driven decision-making

## 10. Asking questions including, "Does my analysis answer the original question?" and "Are there other angles I haven't considered?" enable data analysts to accomplish what tasks? Select all that apply

`A. Consider the best ways to share data with others`
`B. Use data to get to a solid conclusion`
C. Identify primary and secondary stakeholders
`D. Help team members make informed, data-driven decisions`

## 11. A data analytics team works to recognize the current problem. Then, they organize available information to reveal gaps and opportunities. Finally, they identify the available options. These steps are part of what process?

A. Applying the SMART methodology
`B. Using structured thinking`
C. Categorizing things
D. Making connections
