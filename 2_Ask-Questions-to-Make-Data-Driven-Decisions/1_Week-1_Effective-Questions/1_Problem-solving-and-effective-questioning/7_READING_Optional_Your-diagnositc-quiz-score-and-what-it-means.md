# Optional: Your diagnostic quiz score and what it means

Thank you for taking the optional diagnostic quiz. In order to earn your certificate, you will need an overall score of 80% or higher on the graded materials in this program. Your diagnostic quiz results will help you decide if you should follow the speed track for this course. The speed track allows you to skip over the lesson material and go straight to the weekly challenges and the course challenge, which lead to your overall score. Read on to figure out your next steps based on your quiz score:

## If you scored 100% on the diagnostic quiz:

- You are probably familiar with the Ask phase of the data analysis process and can take the speed track to move on to Course 3.
- You must take each of the weekly challenges and the course challenge, which will count toward the 80% overall score needed to earn the certificate. To help you find these items more quickly, we’ve identified them with asterisks in the course materials (for example: *course challenge*).
- After you complete the weekly challenges and course challenge, proceed to Course 3.
- You are welcome to review videos, readings, and activities throughout the course based on your interests.

## If you scored between 90% and 99% on the diagnostic quiz:

- You are probably familiar with the Ask phase of the data analysis process and might consider taking the speed track to move on to Course 3.
- However, we still recommend that you go through the Course 2 lesson materials to review areas where you might have some gaps before proceeding to Course 3.
- You must take each of the weekly challenges and the course challenge, which will count toward the 80% overall score needed to earn the certificate. To help you find these items more quickly, we’ve identified them with asterisks in the course materials (for example: *course challenge*).

- You must take the weekly challenges and the course challenge, which will count toward the 80% overall score needed to earn the certificate. To help you find these items more quickly, we’ve identified them with asterisks in the course materials (for example: *course challenge*).
