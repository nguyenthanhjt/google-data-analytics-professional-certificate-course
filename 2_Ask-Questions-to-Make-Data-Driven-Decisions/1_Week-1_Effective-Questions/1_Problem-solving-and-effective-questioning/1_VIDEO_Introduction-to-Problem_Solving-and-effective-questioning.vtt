00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.030
Welcome to the second course in
the Google Data Analytics certificate.

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.850
If you completed Course One,
we met briefly at the beginning,

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.515
but for
those of you who are just joining us,

4
00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:14.990
my name is Ximena, and
I'm a Google Finance data analyst.

5
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.173
I think it's really wonderful
that you're here with me

6
00:00:18.173 --> 00:00:21.637
learning about the fascinating
field of data analytics.

7
00:00:21.637 --> 00:00:25.350
Learning and education have
always been very important to me.

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.274
When I was young, my mom always said,
"I can't leave you an inheritance, but

9
00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:31.030
I can give you an education that

10
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.606
opens doors."
That always pushed me to keep learning, and

11
00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:39.260
that education gave me the confidence
to apply for my job at Google.

12
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.760
Now I get to do really
meaningful work every day.

13
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.950
Just recently I worked as an analyst
on a team called Verily Life Sciences.

14
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.650
We were helping to get life-saving medical
supplies to those who need it most.

15
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.244
To do this, we forecasted what health
care professionals would need on hand and

16
00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:58.860
then shared that information with networks.

17
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.300
The information that my
team provided helped make

18
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.040
data driven decisions that
actually saved lives.

19
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.250
I'm thrilled to be your instructor for
this course.

20
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.721
We're going to talk about
the difference between effective and

21
00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:15.449
ineffective questions and
learn how to ask great questions that lead

22
00:01:15.449 --> 00:01:18.483
to insights that can help
you solve business problems.

23
00:01:18.483 --> 00:01:23.942
You will discover that effective questions
help you to make the most of all

24
00:01:23.942 --> 00:01:29.580
the data analysis phases. You may
remember that these phases include ask,

25
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.125
prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

26
00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:36.471
In the ask step,
we define the problem we're solving and

27
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:40.250
make sure that we fully understand
stakeholder expectations.

28
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.484
This will help keep you
focused on the actual problem,

29
00:01:43.484 --> 00:01:46.030
which leads to more successful outcomes.

30
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.963
So we'll begin this course by
talking about problem solving and

31
00:01:49.963 --> 00:01:54.890
some of the common types of business
problems that data analysts help solve.

32
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.720
And because this course focuses on
the ask phase, you'll learn how to craft

33
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.020
effective questions that help you collect
the right data to solve those problems.

34
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.758
Next, we'll talk about the many
different types of data.

35
00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:11.840
You'll learn how and
when each is the most useful.

36
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.965
You'll also get a chance to explore
spreadsheets further and discover

37
00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:19.688
how they can help make your data
analysis even more effective.

38
00:02:19.688 --> 00:02:22.830
And then we'll start learning
about structured thinking.

39
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.920
Structured thinking is the process of
recognizing the current problem or

40
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.509
situation, organizing
available information,

41
00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:36.280
revealing gaps and opportunities,
and identifying the options.

42
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.525
In this process, you address a vague, complex
problem by breaking it down into smaller

43
00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:46.619
steps, and then those steps lead you to
a logical solution. We'll work together

44
00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:51.810
to be sure you fully understand how to
use structured thinking and data analysis.

45
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.730
Finally, we'll learn some proven strategies
for communicating with others effectively.

46
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.655
I can't wait to share more about my
passion for data analytics with you, so

47
00:03:00.655 --> 00:03:01.790
let's get started.
