# Practice Quiz: Self-Reflection: Data analyst scenarios

## Overview

Now that you have been introduced to the SMART framework for asking questions, you can pause to apply what you are learning. In this self-reflection, you will consider the questions you would ask in a specific scenario.

This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to apply your knowledge of the SMART question framework to your own data investigations. As you answer questions—and come up with questions of your own—you will consider concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You’ve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

## The scenario

You are three weeks into your new job as a junior data analyst. The company you work for has just collected data on their weekend sales. Your manager asks you to perform a “deep dive” into this data. To get this project started, you must ask some questions and get some information.

### SMART questions

As a refresher, SMART questions are:

- `Specific questions` are simple, significant and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas.
- Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed.
- Action-oriented questions encourage change.
Relevant questions matter, are important and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve.
- Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied.

Next, you will use the SMART framework to ask effective questions about the scenario above. Then, you will reflect on the topics your SMART questions should address.

### Ask the right type of questions

You can apply the SMART framework to all types of questions. The type of questions you ask can help you explore deeper with your data. Consider the ways your questions help you examine objectives, audience, time, security, and resources.

Some common topics for questions include:

- Objectives
- Audience
- Time
- Resources
- Security

Think about how you can ask SMART questions about each of these topics.

## Reflection

Consider the scenario above:

- Based on the SMART framework, which questions are most important to ask?
- How will these questions clarify the requirements and goals for the project?
- How does asking detailed, specific questions benefit you when planning for a project? Can vague or unclear questions harm a project?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.

### My reflection

- What is the scope of weekend data? When does it start and ends? Does it contain customer demographic data?
- When is the project due?
- Are there any specific challenges or obstacles to solve? What is the problems/issue?
- Who are the primary stakeholders for this project, and what do they expect this project to do for them? What is the outcome should be?
- What resources are available to accomplish the deep dive's goals?
- Who should have the right to access the information?
