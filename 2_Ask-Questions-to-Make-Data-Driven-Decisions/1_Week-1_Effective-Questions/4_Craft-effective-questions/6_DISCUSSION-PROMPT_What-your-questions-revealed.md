### Repsone 1

Through the process of asking SMART questions during a conversation with a friend who works in marketing, I gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of these questions. The questions that provided the most useful and interesting responses were those that adhered closely to the SMART framework. Specifically, the Specific and Measurable questions were particularly successful. They allowed me to delve into precise details about their marketing strategies and metrics. For instance, when I asked, "What specific marketing channels do you utilize for the Mid-autumn festival campaign, and how do you measure their performance?" I received a detailed breakdown of their channel selection and the corresponding KPIs, which greatly enriched my understanding.

Conversely, questions that were less successful tended to be vague or less focused. These questions often led to more general or superficial responses. For example, when I asked, "How do you generally analyze the campaign's success?" without specifying metrics or methods, the response lacked the depth and specificity I needed for a comprehensive understanding.

Overall, this activity reinforced the importance of crafting SMART questions in data-related discussions. It highlighted that the more specific and measurable the questions, the more valuable and insightful the responses tend to be, as they encourage the interviewee to provide concrete, data-driven insights.

### Response 2

Through my conversation with Luu Quang Linh, I discovered that the SMART questions I formulated played a significant role in extracting valuable insights about Bao Ngoc Investment Production Corporation's marketing strategies. The specific questions, tailored to their industry and role, provided detailed and focused responses. For instance, asking about the specific data sources they use in planning for the Mid-autumn festival campaign led to a comprehensive understanding of their data-driven approach. This specificity ensured that our discussion remained on point, resulting in highly useful information.

On the other hand, some of the more vague questions, while still informative, didn't yield as detailed responses. For instance, inquiring about their general data usage without a specific context led to broader, less detailed answers. This highlighted the importance of making questions specific and tailored to the individual's field and responsibilities. It also emphasized how the SMART framework acts as a guide to ensure questions are structured effectively for fruitful discussions.

Overall, this activity reinforced the significance of using SMART questions in data-related discussions. It demonstrated that well-crafted questions not only garner more insightful responses but also help maintain focus and relevance in the conversation. This experience has solidified my understanding of the SMART framework as a powerful tool in extracting meaningful information from data discussions.

### Response 3

In my recent conversation with a friend who works in marketing, I created a set of SMART questions to understand how they utilize data in their role, particularly in preparation for the Mid-autumn festival campaign for Bao Ngoc Investment Production Corporation. Some questions proved to be exceptionally insightful. For instance, asking, "Can you provide specific examples of how data analysis influenced your decision-making for the Mid-autumn festival campaign?" led to a rich discussion. This question's success lay in its specificity and action-oriented nature, prompting my friend to recount concrete instances where data played a pivotal role in shaping their strategies.

On the other hand, some questions yielded less insightful answers. Questions that were vague or lacked specificity, such as, "Do you use data to inform your marketing decisions?" didn't provide the depth of information I was hoping for. These open-ended queries left room for interpretation and didn't guide the conversation towards the desired insights.

Through this exercise, I've learned that the effectiveness of SMART questions lies in their ability to guide discussions, ensuring they revolve around specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound aspects. This exercise reinforced the importance of crafting well-structured questions that not only prompt meaningful responses but also facilitate a deeper understanding of the topic at hand.

Some questions proved to be exceptionally insightful because they were specific and action-oriented. For instance, asking, "Can you provide specific examples of how data analysis influenced your decision-making for the Mid-autumn festival campaign?" led to a rich discussion. The specificity of this question made it easier for my friend to recall concrete instances where data played a pivotal role in shaping their marketing strategies.

On the other hand, some questions yielded less insightful answers due to their vagueness or lack of specificity. For instance, questions like, "Do you use data to inform your marketing decisions?" didn't provide the depth of information I was hoping for. These open-ended queries left room for interpretation and didn't guide the conversation towards the desired insights.

This exercise has reinforced the idea that the effectiveness of SMART questions is rooted in their ability to focus discussions on specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound aspects. Crafting questions with these attributes not only prompts meaningful responses but also ensures that the conversation revolves around the most important and valuable aspects of the topic being discussed.
