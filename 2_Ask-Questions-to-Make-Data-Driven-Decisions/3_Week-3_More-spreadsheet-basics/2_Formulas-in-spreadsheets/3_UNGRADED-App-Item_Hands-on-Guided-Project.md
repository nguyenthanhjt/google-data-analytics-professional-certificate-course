# Hands-on Guided Project: Create a Personal Spending Budget Using Google Sheets

## About Guided Projects

In this Guided Project, you will be assigned a cloud desktop that has the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along with the instructor to complete the project's tasks.

You will work side-by-side with an industry expert to help a fictional client create a personal spending budget in order to make data-informed decisions about how to spend money. To do this, you will apply your knowledge of spreadsheet formulas to add values, calculate averages, and assess spending patterns across different expense categories.

After completing this project, you can reference a summary of the key takeaways from this [document link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lol54vkw9nJsU2x3U098zVMieAm6yCTAQe0VTktC-K8/template/preview) OR [Key-Takeaways_Guided-Project_Create-a-Personal-Spending-Budget-Using-Google-Sheets.docx](./Key-Takeaways_Guided-Project_Create-a-Personal-Spending-Budget-Using-Google-Sheets.docx)
