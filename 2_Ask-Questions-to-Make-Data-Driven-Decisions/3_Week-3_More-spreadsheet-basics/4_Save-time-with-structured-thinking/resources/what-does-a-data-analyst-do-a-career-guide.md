## What is data analysis?

Data analysis is the process of gleaning insights from data to inform better business decisions. The process of analyzing data typically moves through five iterative phases:
    - Identify the data you want to analyze
    - Collect the data
    - Clean the data in preparation for analysis
    - Analyze the data
    - Interpret the results of the analysis

Data analysis can take different forms, depending on the question you’re trying to answer. You can read more about the types of data analysis here.
