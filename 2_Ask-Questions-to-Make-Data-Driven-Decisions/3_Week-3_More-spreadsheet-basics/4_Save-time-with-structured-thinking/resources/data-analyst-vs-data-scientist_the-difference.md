# Data Analyst vs. Data Scientist: What’s the Difference?

> Written by Coursera • Updated on Jun 16, 2023

Both data analysts and data scientists work with data, but they do so in different ways.

Data analysts and data scientists represent two of the most in-demand, high-paying jobs, alongside AI and machine learning specialists and digital transformation specialists, according to the World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2023 [1].

While there’s undeniably plenty of interest in data professionals, it may not always be clear what the difference is between a data analyst and a data scientist. Both roles work with data, but they do so in different ways.

## Data analysts and data scientists: What do they do?

One of the biggest differences between data analysts and scientists is what they do with data. 

**Data analysts** typically work with structured data to solve tangible business problems using tools like SQL, R or Python programming languages, data visualization software, and statistical analysis. Common tasks for a data analyst might include:

- Collaborating with organizational leaders to identify informational needs
- Acquiring data from primary and secondary sources
- Cleaning and reorganizing data for analysis
- Analyzing data sets to spot trends and patterns that can be translated into actionable insights
- Presenting findings in an easy-to-understand way to inform data-driven decisions

**Data scientists** often deal with the unknown by using more advanced data techniques to make predictions about the future. They might automate their own machine learning algorithms or design predictive modeling processes that can handle both structured and unstructured data. This role is generally considered a more advanced version of a data analyst. Some day-to-day tasks might include:

- Gathering, cleaning, and processing raw data
- Designing predictive models and machine learning algorithms to mine big data sets
- Developing tools and processes to monitor and analyze data accuracy
- Building data visualization tools, dashboards, and reports
- Writing programs to automate data collection and processing

## Data science vs. analytics: Educational requirements

Most data analyst roles require at least a bachelor’s degree in a field like mathematics, statistics, computer science, or finance. Data scientists (as well as many advanced data analysts) typically have a master’s or doctoral degree in data science, information technology, mathematics, or statistics.

While a degree has generally been the primary path toward a career in data, some new options are emerging for those without a degree or previous experience. By earning a Professional Certificate in data analytics from [Google](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) or [IBM](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst), both available on Coursera, you can build the skills necessary for an entry-level role as a data analyst in less than six months of study. Upon completion of the Google Certificate, you’ll have access to a hiring consortium of more than 130 companies.

If you’re just starting out, working as a data analyst first can be a good way to launch a career as a data scientist.

## Data skills for scientists and analysts

Data scientists and data analysts both work with data, but each role uses a slightly different set of skills and tools. Many skills involved in data science build off of those data analysts use. Here’s a look at how they compare.

|Data analyst|Data scientist|
|-|-|
|Mathematics|	Foundational math, statistics	|Advanced statistics, predictive analytics|
|Programming|	Basic fluency in R, Python, SQL	|Advanced object-oriented programming|
|Software and tools|	SAS, Excel, business intelligence software	|Hadoop, MySQL, TensorFlow, Spark|
|Other skills|	Analytical thinking, data visualization	|Machine learning, data modeling|
