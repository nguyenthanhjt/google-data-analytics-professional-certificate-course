# Learning Log: Review file structure and naming conventions

## Overview

In the previous lesson, you were introduced to file structuring and naming conventions. Now, you’ll complete an entry in your learning log reviewing these concepts and reflecting on why they are so important. By the time you complete this entry, you will have a stronger understanding of how and why data analysts use file structuring and naming conventions on the job. This will help you think critically about file structuring and naming for your own projects in the future and keep your work more organized.

## Review best practices

Before you begin thinking about what sort of naming conventions and patterns you would use in your own projects, take a moment to review the best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
    - When creating a file structure and naming convention pattern for a project, you should always:
    - Work out your conventions early in your project. The earlier you start, the more organized you’ll be. 
    - Align file naming conventions with your team. Conventions are most useful when everyone follows them.
    - Make sure filenames are meaningful. Stick to a consistent pattern that contains the most useful information needed.
    - Keep file names short and to the point.

This includes understanding the expected structure of folders and files in a project. Where does your data live? Your spreadsheets? Your data visualizations? Being able to navigate your folders easily makes for a well-structured project. 

Remember, there are some stylistic choices you’ll need to make when it comes to filename conventions. However, there are still best practices you should follow here, too:

|Formatting Convention|Example|
|---------------------|-------|
|Format Dates as yyyymmdd|SalesReport20201125|
|Lead revision numbers with 0|SalesReport20201125v02|
|Use hyphens, underscores, or capitalized letters|SalesReport_2020_11_25_v02|

You will reflect on the importance of these conventions and how you would approach file structuring and naming for your own projects in the learning log template linked below.

## Reflection

In your learning log template, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) responding to each of the questions about file structuring and naming conventions below:

- Why are file structure and naming conventions so important? What are the consequences of poor organization for data analysts at work?
  - Effective file structure and naming conventions are crucial as they ensure clarity, accessibility, and consistency in data management. Poor organization can lead to confusion, wasted time, and potential errors for data analysts. It may result in difficulty locating specific files, hindering collaboration, and impacting the overall efficiency of data-related tasks.
- How would you structure folders and files? What naming conventions would you use?
  - For folders, I would adopt a logical hierarchy, grouping related files together. I'd create main folders for different project aspects (e.g., Data, Analysis, Reports) with subfolders for more granular organization. In naming conventions, I'd use a format like yyyymmdd for dates and lead revision numbers with a zero (e.g., SalesReport_20201125_v02). I'd also avoid spaces, opting for hyphens, underscores, or capitalized letters.
- What appeals to you about these choices?
  - These choices ensure consistency and ease of reference. The date format follows international standards, reducing ambiguity. Leading revision numbers with a zero maintains a clear sequence. Using hyphens, underscores, or capitalized letters instead of spaces aligns with best practices, ensuring compatibility across various applications, including SQL. Overall, these choices contribute to an organized and efficient data management system.
