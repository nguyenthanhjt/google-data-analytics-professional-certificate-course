Hey, good to have you back. Up until now, we've
focused on preparing your data for processing
and analysis. In these next videos, we'll explore another big
part of that process, organizing and
protecting your data. Keeping your data organized is important for a few reasons; it makes it easier
to find and use, helps you avoid making
mistakes during your analysis and
helps to protect it. Coming up, we'll go over the basics of organizing data for personal and professional use and file naming conventions. Then we'll take a look at some security features
for spreadsheets. By the end of these
next few videos, you'll be able to do all
these things and you'll be able to explain these
steps to stakeholders, so they can feel confident that your data practices
are safe and secure. When you're ready to get started, go ahead to the next video. There we'll get started with organizing data for personal use.
