- Hey again
- So you've heard me mention the idea of using meaningful and logical file names to help organize your data
- But using consistent file names can also streamline or even automate your analysis process, saving you time and energy in the long run
- When you use consistent guidelines that describe the content, date, or version of a file and its name, you're using file naming conventions
- As we've already discovered, these file naming conventions help us organize, access, process, and analyze our data
- So here are some general tips on creating file naming conventions that are both logical and functional
- Here's some quick file naming Do's
- Work out your conventions early to avoid having to spend time redoing it later
- Align your file naming with your team and make sure your file names are meaningful with references to the project name, creation date, revision version, or any other useful information needed to understand what's in that file
- Now, there's some other simple things you can do to make sure your file naming conventions are on point
- First of all, you want to keep your file name short and sweet
- They're supposed to be quick reference points that tell you what's in a file
- From earlier videos, we know that we want to include dates and revision numbers in our file names
- I recommend formatting it by year, month, and day because that follows the international date standard
- Different countries have different date conventions, so keep that in mind
- When you include revision numbers in a file name, lead with a zero, so that if you run into double digits of revisions, it's already built into your conventions
- Another good rule is to use hyphens, underscores, or capitalized letters instead of using spaces
- Spaces and special characters might not be recognized by your software
- Plus avoiding spaces definitely makes it easier to work in SQL
- My last bit of advice: create a text file that lays out all your naming conventions on a project
- This is really helpful if someone new joins your team, or if you just need a quick reminder while you're working on something
- We talked about this earlier when we covered metadata, which is data about data
- It helps explain what data there is and how it's being organized
- When you use consistent, meaningful file naming conventions throughout your project, your data will be easy to find and use, and you can save yourself time, too
- Up next, we'll keep looking at spreadsheets and we'll talk about security features and how you can use them to protect your data now that it's organized
- See you there.

## Key Points

- Purpose of Consistent File Names:
  - Consistent file names streamline and may even automate the analysis process, saving time and effort.
  - File naming conventions aid in organizing, accessing, processing, and analyzing data.
- General Tips for File Naming Conventions:
  - Work out Conventions Early:
    - Avoid spending time redoing conventions later by establishing them early.
  - Align with Team:
  - Ensure alignment with the team's file naming conventions.
  - Make file names meaningful with references to project name, creation date, revision version, or other relevant information.
- File Naming Do's:
  - Keep it Short:
    - File names should be concise for quick reference.
  - Include Dates and Revision Numbers:
    - Include dates and revision numbers in file names.
    - Recommend formatting dates as year, month, and day following the international date standard.
- Use of Hyphens, Underscores, or Capitalized Letters:
  - Instead of spaces, use hyphens, underscores, or capitalized letters.
  - Spaces and special characters may not be recognized by some software, and avoiding spaces makes it easier to work in SQL.
- Leading Zero for Revision Numbers:
  - Lead with a zero for revision numbers to accommodate double digits.
- Create a Text File with Naming Conventions:
  - Helpful for new team members or as a quick reminder during work.
  - Aligns with the concept of metadata, providing information about how data is organized.
- Benefits of Consistent Naming Conventions:
  - Facilitates easy finding and usage of data.
  - Time-saving due to a well-organized data structure.
- Upcoming Topic:
  - The next topic will cover spreadsheets and security features, emphasizing data protection in an organized environment.
