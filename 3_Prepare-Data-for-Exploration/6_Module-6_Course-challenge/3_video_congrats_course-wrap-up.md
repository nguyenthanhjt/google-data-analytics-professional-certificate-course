- Welcome back
- Before we get started, let's take a moment to celebrate how far you've come and everything you've learned in this course
- You're almost halfway through this program
- Thanks for sticking with it
- So far you've learned about data types and data structures and discovered the importance of bias and credibility in data preparation and analysis
- We also explored databases, different ways to organize and protect your data and even how to join the data analytics community
- All of this will help you prepare your data for the next step in the data analysis life cycle: processing
- Processing your data to make sure that it's clean and complete is the last step you take before you start analyzing it
- And that's exactly what the next course is all about
- I'm excited to reintroduce fellow Googler, Sally, Performance Measurement and Analytical Lead
- She's going to be your guide throughout this next course, which is all about cleaning and processing your data for analysis
- Coming up, you're going to learn about integrity and data analytics, basic data cleaning skills and data cleaning in SQL
- We'll also learn how to verify and report your data cleaning results and, if you're up for it, adding data to your resume
- Before you go, let me just say one more time: fantastic job! When you're ready, you can go ahead and start the next course
- Sally will be there to guide you through it.
