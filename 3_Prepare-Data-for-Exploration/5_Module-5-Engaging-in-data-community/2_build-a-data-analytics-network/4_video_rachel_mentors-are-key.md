- Hi
- My name is Rachel, and I'm the business systems and analytics lead at Verily
- I've been lucky enough to have some really great mentors over the course of my career, and I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to have someone in your corner as you're navigating all of the different ins and outs of your career
- For me, I have had some wonderful mentors who have guided me through some really tough career decisions, starting way back at the very beginning
- My first mentor was a professor at school, and this professor gave me wonderful advice of how to follow my dreams and how to lean into what I was interested in
- I think it's very important to also have great mentors at work
- My mentor helps me navigate all the ins and outs of my organization, all the ins and outs of the politics sometimes, and also helps me make decisions on what to do next
- It's nice to have a mentor who's outside of what's going on, but it's also really nice to sometimes have a mentor who understands the environment
- I catch up with my mentor regularly just to touch base, just to see how we're doing, to maintain a relationship, but I specifically will schedule time with my mentor when I'm wrestling with some sort of tough question or when I have a pivotal moment coming up
- For example, I've had some great conversations with my mentor about whether I really lean in on the finance side of my career or whether I want to lean in on the IT side and the system side, and helping make some of those decisions about where to focus and what to take some classes in, what to continue education on, and where to lean in with upcoming projects
- Talking that through with somebody has really helped me make sense of some jumbled thoughts and figure out where to go next
- I think the most important thing to look for in a mentor is somebody who you will get along with and somebody that you trust
- This is a person that you are going to go to with some of potentially the toughest choices of your career, looking to them for guidance and for help and for support
- My most successful mentors, the most successful mentoring relationships that I've had, have been with people who I'm close to personally or professionally and who I trust and who I feel comfortable sharing potentially deep thoughts with, and a lot of potentially sensitive details about what I'm thinking, what I'm going through, and what I want so that they can help me make sense of that and figure out what to do
- I love now that I can pay that forward and share some of the wisdom that I've learned from my mentors and from some of the experiences that I've had in my career and help share that with someone else so that they can navigate some of their same decisions and some of those same situations, and hopefully learn from some of my experiences and some of my mistakes, and helping pay that forward is what's really exciting about being a mentor.
