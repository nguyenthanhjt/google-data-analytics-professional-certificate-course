# Getting started with LinkedIn

## Signing up

Signing up with LinkedIn is simple. Just follow these simple steps:

1. Browse to [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/)
2. Click Join now or Join with resume.

If you clicked **Join now**:

1. Enter your email address and a password and click Agree & Join (or click Join with Google to link to a Google account).
2. Enter your first and last name and click Continue.
3. Enter your country/region, your postal code, and location with the area (this helps LinkedIn find job opportunities near you).
4. Enter your most recent job title, or select I’m a student.
5. If you entered your most recent job title, select your employment type and enter the name of your most recent company.
6. If you selected self-employed or freelance, LinkedIn will ask for your industry.
7. Click confirm your email address. You will receive an email from LinkedIn.
8. To confirm your email address, click Agree & Confirm in your email.
9. LinkedIn will then ask if you are looking for a job. Click the answer that applies. If you select Yes, LinkedIn will help you start looking for job opportunities.

If you clicked **Join with resume**:

1. Click Upload your resume and select the file to upload.
2. Follow any of the steps under Join Now that are relevant.

The Join with resume option saves you some time because it auto-fills most of the information from your resume. And just like that, your initial profile is now ready!

## Including basic information in your profile

It is a good idea to take your time filling out every section of your profile. This helps recruiters find your profile and helps people you connect with get to know you better. Start with your photo. Here are some tips to help you choose a great picture for your new profile:

- Choose an image that looks like you: You want to make sure that your profile is the best representation of you and that includes your photo. You want a potential connection or potential employer to be able to recognize you from your profile picture if you were to meet.
- Use your industry as an example: If you are having trouble deciding what is appropriate for your profile image, look at other profiles in the same industry or from companies you are interested in to get a better sense of what you should be doing.
- Choose a high-resolution image: The better the resolution, the better impression it makes, so make sure the image you choose isn’t blurry. The ideal image size for a LinkedIn profile picture is 400 x 400 pixels. Use a photo where your face takes up at least 60% of the space in the frame.
- Remember to smile: Your profile picture is a snapshot of who you are as a person so it is okay to be serious in your photo. But smiling helps put potential connections and potential employers at ease. 

## Adding connections

Connections are a great way to keep up to date with your previous coworkers, colleagues, classmates, or even companies you want to work with. The world is a big place with a lot of people. So here are some tips to help get you started.

1. Connect to people you know personally.
2. Add a personal touch to your invitation message. Instead of just letting them know you would like to connect, let them know why.
3. Make sure your profile picture is current so people can recognize you.
4. Add value. Provide them with a resource, a website link, or even some content they might find interesting in your invitation to connect.

## Finding leaders and influencers

LinkedIn is a great place to find great people and great ideas. From technology to marketing, and everything in between, there are all kinds of influencers and thought leaders active on LinkedIn. If you have ever wanted to know the thoughts of some of the most influential and respected minds in a certain field, LinkedIn is a great place to start. Following your favorite people takes only a few minutes. You can search for people or companies individually, or you can use these lists as starting points.
