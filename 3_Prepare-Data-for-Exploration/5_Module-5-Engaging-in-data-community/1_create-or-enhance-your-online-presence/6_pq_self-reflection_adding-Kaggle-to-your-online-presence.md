## Get social on Kaggle

As you get more familiar with the career options available to data analysts, you’ll find that it’s important to have an online presence. By engaging with the data community online, you can ask questions, learn new skills, and demonstrate your achievements to potential employers.

You’ve already covered several ways that you can build your online presence, from LinkedIn to GitHub to Medium. To develop a stronger connection to the data community and interact with fellow data professionals and enthusiasts, you can also build an online presence on Kaggle.

In addition to datasets, Kaggle has micro-courses, competitions, forums, and a large community of users. With the [Kaggle Progression System](https://www.kaggle.com/progression/), you track your progress and growth within the platform and demonstrate your data skills and savvy to employers and colleagues.

### Profile features

To start on Kaggle, you should set up a profile. Your Kaggle profile page is a collection of all of your work and accomplishments on Kaggle. Check out an example profile page to explore how a profile can be used to share information:
[Heads or Tails](https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails)

As you browse the Kaggle profile for Heads or Tails, you can also observe the work they did to reach high ranks in each category. They also include links. For example, they include a link from their profile to their personal blog and videos. This allows them to share their Kaggle profile with prospective employers in order to highlight their skills and progress.

Building up your Kaggle profile, or any other form of social media presence, takes time. Being patient with your progress and engaging consistently will draw more attention to your work.

Before moving into the next section, take a few minutes to look at different Kaggler profiles, and think about what they’re doing that inspires you. If you encounter a profile of someone whose work you’d like to follow, click the **Follow User** button on their profile.
