- Hey again
- Today, a lot of us spend a lot of time connecting with people online
- We stay in touch with family and friends we can't see everyday, or post about what we're doing, eating, and watching on social media
- But our presence online goes beyond the personal
- A consistent and professional online presence is an important tool in building a career in data analytics
- A professional online presence is important for a few key reasons
- First, it can help potential employers find you
- Second, it lets you make connections with other data analysts in your field, learn and share data findings, and maybe even participate in community events
- Keep in mind that a lot of networking happens online now
- If you aren't keeping up your online presence, you might be missing out on great opportunities without even knowing it
- There are lots of different professional sites that you can take advantage of as you start building your own online presence
- For now though, we'll focus on LinkedIn and GitHub
- LinkedIn is specifically designed to help people make connections with other people in their field
- It's a great way to follow trends in your industry, learn from industry leaders, and stay engaged with the wider professional community
- And if you're actively looking for a new job, LinkedIn has job boards that you can search
- You can even narrow down your location to see who's hiring near you
- Plus, job recruiters frequently use LinkedIn to find potential data analysts for new projects
- It's always a good idea to keep your LinkedIn profile up to date with your resume
- You might find yourself being recruited
- LinkedIn also lets you connect with people and build a network
- You can share exciting things happening in your professional life and keep up with where your connections go
- You never know when you might end up working with someone again
- With LinkedIn, you can be endorsed for having job skills or endorse other people
- If you impress someone at a previous job, they can let other people know just how awesome you are to work with
- GitHub, the other website I mentioned earlier, is a little different
- GitHub is part code-sharing site, part social media
- It has an active community collaborating and sharing insights to build resources
- You can talk with other GitHub users on the forum, use the community-driven wikis, or even use it to manage team projects
- GitHub also hosts community events where you can meet other people in the field and learn some new things
- GitHub has a lot of features for you to check out
- The best way to learn more about it is to check it out for yourself
- We'll also be talking more about GitHub later in the program
- Sometimes if you're looking for a new career, finding someone who has something in common with you, like shared interests or the same hometown, and reaching out to them, can help a lot
- Just a 15-minute conversation with someone could set you on the path to a new career, whether that's on a professional networking site like LinkedIn, or at a community event hosted by GitHub
- LinkedIn has become one of the standard professional social media sites, so it's a good starting place for building your online presence
- GitHub offers a lot of really great tools for data analysts in the community
- If you don't already have accounts on these sites, challenge yourself to set them up now
- Connect with other people
- Share some updates about what you're working on right now
- If you're already using LinkedIn and GitHub, great news: we're going to talk more about how to enhance your existing social media presence next time
- See you soon.
