Hey, it's great to have you
back! So far we've covered everything from using SQL to the key aspects of data ethics. You've developed a huge range of skills, and
they're all going to help you on your journey to
a career in data analytics. But you don't have to do
everything on your own. As a data analyst, you'll be part of a
growing data community. By building a consistent and professional online presence, you'll be able to
connect to others in your field and
expand your network. Coming up, you'll
learn how you can get started building your
online presence. Or if you're already
part of the community, how you can take your online
network even further. With remote, online work
becoming more and more common, so is online networking. That means having and maintaining a well-developed
online presence could open the door to so
many new opportunities. I find myself reaching
out to people I've worked with throughout my
career to stay in touch, ask them questions about
their experiences, and just see what interesting
things they're doing, and that's only
possible because I keep up my online presence. Join me in the next
video to get started building your online
presence, and get connected!
