- Hello again
- So far we've learned that the biases we have as people can end up creating biased data, we're biased when we have preferences based on our own preconceived or even subconscious notions
- When data is biased, it can systematically skew results in a certain direction, making them unreliable
- We covered this earlier using sampling bias as an example
- Sampling bias is when a sample isn't representative of the population as a whole
- You can avoid this by making sure the sample is chosen at random, so that all parts of the population have an equal chance of being included
- If you don't use random sampling during data collection, you end up favoring one outcome
- Here's a simple way to look at it
- Let's say there are 50 students in one class, and you want to know if the majority of the class prefers warm or cold weather
- you decide to survey the first 10 students you meet, and based on their responses, you determine that the entire class prefers warm weather
- But wait, there's some bias there
- those first 10 people were all women, so only women were included in your survey
- Your survey wasn't a fair representation of the entire class because it didn't include other identifiers across the gender spectrum
- If you'd use a more randomized sample of the population that included all genders, you'd have an unbiased sample
- Unbiased sampling results in a sample that's representative of the population being measured
- Another great way to discover if you're working with unbiased data is to bring the results to life with visualizations
- In the class example we just covered, you could visualize the number of students in the class overall, and their gender identities with a bar chart
- You could then compare that to a similar bar chart showing the students you surveyed
- This will help you easily identify any misalignment with your sample
- Okay, now that we know what bias looks like from a sampling perspective, let's explore some other types of bias, and how to recognize them.

## Questions

### Question 1:An unbiased sample is representative of the population being measured. Which of the following helps ensure unbiased sampling?

- `Using random sampling during data collection`: Using random sampling during data collection helps ensure unbiased sampling. 
- Skewing results in a certain direction
- Storing data in a spreadsheet
- Writing survey questions that encourage specific responses

### Question 2: There are 50 students in a class. A data analyst wants to know if a majority of students like the instructor. They decide to survey the 15 students who earned an A in the class because these students were clearly paying attention to the instructor. Which of the following statements best describes this sample?

- Representative
- Objective
- Impartial
- `Biased`:This is a biased sample because it only includes students who earned A’s. It’s not representative of the population.

## Keypoints

- Introduction to Bias and Data:
  - Biases that individuals have can lead to the creation of biased data.
  - Biased data can systematically skew results, making them unreliable.
- Sampling Bias Example:
  - Sampling bias occurs when a sample is not representative of the entire population.
  - Random sampling is crucial to ensure all parts of the population have an equal chance of being included.
- Illustration of Bias in Survey:
  - Example: Surveying the first 10 students about weather preferences without random sampling.
  - Bias introduced as all 10 students were women, leading to an inaccurate representation of the entire class.
- Importance of Randomized Sampling:
  - Randomized sampling ensures an unbiased representation of the population being measured.
- Visualizing Data to Identify Bias:
  - Visualizations, such as bar charts, can help bring data to life and identify biases.
  - Visualizing the gender identities of all students in the class and comparing it to the surveyed group helps identify misalignments.
- Recognizing Other Types of Bias:
  - Beyond sampling bias, there are other types of bias to explore.
  - The section sets the stage for further exploration of various biases and how to recognize them.
