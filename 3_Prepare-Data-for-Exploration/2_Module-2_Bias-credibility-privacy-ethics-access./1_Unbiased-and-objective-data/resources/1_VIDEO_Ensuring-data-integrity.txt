Welcome back. In an earlier course, we talked about how
to prepare data in a way that helps you tell a meaningful story. Now let's find out what comes next. Like all good tales, your data story will
be filled with characters, questions, challenges, conflict, and
hopefully a resolution. The trick is to avoid the conflict,
overcome the challenges and answer the questions. That's what this course is all about. Here's how we'll do it. First, you'll learn how to analyze
data for bias and credibility. This is very important because even
the most sound data can be skewed or misinterpreted. Then we'll learn about the importance
of being good and bad. Yep, just like when we were kids. But in this case,
we'll be exploring good data sources and learning how to steer clear
of their nemesis, bad data. After that, we'll learn more about the
world of data ethics, privacy and access. As more and more data becomes available,
and the algorithms we create to use this data become more complex and
sophisticated, new issues keep popping up. We need to ask questions like,
who owns all this data? How much control do we have
over the privacy of data? Can we use and
reuse data however we want to? As a data analyst, it's important to
understand data ethics and privacy because in your work, you'll make a lot of
judgment calls on the correct use and application of data. I'm excited to walk you through
some of the questions, answers, risks and rewards involved. Let's open up the first chapter of
this data story in our next video.
