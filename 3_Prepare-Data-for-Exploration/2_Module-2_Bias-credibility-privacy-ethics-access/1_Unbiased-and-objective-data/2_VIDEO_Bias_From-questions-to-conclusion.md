- Let's kick things off by traveling back in time, well, in our minds at least
- My real time machine's in the shop
- Imagine you're back in middle school and you've entered a project for the science fair
- You worked hard for weeks perfecting every element and they're about to announce the winners
- You close your eyes, take a deep breath, and you hear them call your name for second place
- Bummer, you really wanted that first-place trophy, but hey, you'll take the ribbon for recognition
- The next day you learn the judge was the winner's uncle
- How is that fair!? Can he really be expected to choose a winner fairly when his own family member is one of the contestants? He's probably biased! Maybe his niece deserved to win and maybe not
- But the point is: it's very easy to make a case for bias in that scenario0
- This is a super-simple example, but the truth is, we run into bias all the time in everyday life
- Our brains are biologically designed to streamline thinking and make quick judgments
- Bias has evolved to become a preference in favor of or against a person, group of people, or thing
- It can be conscious or subconscious
- The good news is once we know and accept that we have bias, we can start to recognize our own patterns of thinking and learn how to manage it
- It's important to know that bias can also find its way into the world of data
- Data bias is a type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction
- Maybe the questions on a survey had a particular slant to influence answers, or maybe the sample group wasn't truly representative of the population being studied
- For example, if you're going to take the median age of the US patient population with health insurance, you wouldn't just use a sample of Medicare patients who are 65 and older
- Bias can also happen if a sample group lacks inclusivity
- For example, people with disabilities tend to be under-identified, under-represented, or excluded in mainstream health research
- The way you collect data can also bias a data set
- For example, if you give people only a short time to answer questions, their responses will be rushed
- When we're rushed, we make more mistakes, which can affect the quality of our data and create biased outcomes
- As a data analyst, you have to think about bias and fairness from the moment you start collecting data to the time you present your conclusions
- After all, those conclusions can have serious implications
- Think about this: it's been acknowledged that clinical studies of heart health tend to include a lot more men than women
- This has led to women failing to recognize symptoms and ultimately having their heart conditions go undetected and untreated
- That's just one way bias can have a very real impact
- While we've come a long way in recognizing bias, it still led to you losing out to the judge's niece at that science competition
- It's still influencing business decisions, health care choices and access, governmental action, and more
- So we've still got work to do
- Coming up, we'll show you how to identify bias in the data itself, and explore some scenarios when you may actually benefit from it.

## Keypoints

- Introduction to Bias:
  - Bias is introduced using a relatable scenario from a science fair competition.
  - Illustration of bias in the context of a judge's potential favoritism due to a family connection.
- Everyday Bias:
  - Bias is a common occurrence in everyday life.
  - Our brains are naturally designed to make quick judgments, leading to biases.
  - Bias can be conscious or subconscious.
- Recognizing Personal Bias:
  - Acknowledging personal biases is the first step in managing and overcoming them.
  - Understanding and recognizing patterns of thinking can help in addressing bias.
- Data Bias:
  - Data bias is a type of error that systematically skews results in a specific direction.
  - Examples include survey questions with a particular slant or sample groups that are not representative of the population.
- Sample Group and Inclusivity Bias:
  - Choosing a sample group that lacks inclusivity can introduce bias.
  - Under-identification, under-representation, or exclusion of certain groups in research can lead to biased outcomes.
- Collection Method Bias:
  - The way data is collected can introduce bias.
  - For instance, rushed responses due to time constraints can affect data quality and create biased outcomes.
- Role of Data Analyst:
  - Data analysts need to consider bias and fairness from data collection to presenting conclusions.
  - Biased conclusions can have serious implications, affecting areas like business decisions and healthcare choices.
- Real Impact of Bias:
  - An example is given where clinical studies on heart health tend to include more men than women, impacting the recognition and treatment of heart conditions in women.
- Ongoing Challenge:
  - Despite progress in recognizing bias, it continues to influence various aspects such as business decisions, healthcare, and governmental actions.
- Future Topics:
  - The upcoming sections will delve into identifying bias in data and exploring scenarios where bias may have beneficial aspects.
