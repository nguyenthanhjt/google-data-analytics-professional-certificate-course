# Discussion Prompt: Accounting for bias

Bias is a conscious or subconscious preference in favor of or against a person, group of people or thing. You’ve learned that biases can affect people's judgment and skew data. The good news is, once people know and accept that they have biases, they can start to recognize their own patterns of thinking and learn how to improve.

Based on what you’ve learned so far, do you think it’s important to consider bias in your everyday life? Why or why not?

Submit a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing your thoughts about bias. Include a specific example of bias drawn from your everyday life. Then, visit the [discussion forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/discussions)  to read what other learners have written, and engage in discussion about at least two posts.

Participation is optional

## My Response

- In my own life, I see that when people have biased thoughts, they can make unfair decisions leading to a lack of ethics in some cases.
- In my view, it's crucial to be mindful of bias in everyday life as it significantly influences decision-making and interactions. One example from my experience is the workplace; certain projects may unintentionally favor extroverted team members, leading to their ideas gaining more prominence. Recognizing and addressing such biases is essential for fostering a fair and inclusive environment. By acknowledging bias, we can work towards creating a more equitable society where everyone's perspective is valued.

- In my view, acknowledging and addressing bias is crucial in our daily lives. We all have inherent biases that can influence our judgments, decisions, and interactions. Personally, I've noticed bias in the workplace, where certain ideas are favored based on preconceived notions. This can stifle creativity and hinder inclusivity. By recognizing and actively working to counteract bias, we create a more equitable and open-minded environment. It's not just about understanding our own biases but also fostering a culture that values diversity and embraces different perspectives.
