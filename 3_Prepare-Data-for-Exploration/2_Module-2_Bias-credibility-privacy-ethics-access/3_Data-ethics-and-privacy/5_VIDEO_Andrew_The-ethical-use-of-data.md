# Andrew: The ethical use of data

[VIDEO](./resources/5_VIDEO_Andrew_The-ethical-use-of-data.mp4) and [transcript](./resources/5_VIDEO_Andrew_The-ethical-use-of-data.txt)

- My name is Andrew
- I am a senior developer advocate on the ethical AI research group at Google
- As a senior developer advocate, I try and help the larger community build socially responsible AI systems
- One consequence of not using this technology responsibly is the possibility of amplifying or reinforcing unfair biases
- Now these algorithms, these data sets, are often being used in settings where they are deciding the outcome
- Whether it's curating content for an individual or determining whether or not they're eligible for a loan, all these different decision making processes depend on the algorithms and the data sets that are being used in that context
- And so if this were to be handled irresponsibly, then the very outcomes of these systems could potentially harm underrepresented communities, minority groups
- There's a lot that the field, the industry, the community, is learning about the responsible use of data and AI
- So what I try to do is I try to correlate all those different elements, whether it's working with various research groups within Google, working with various product teams at Google, engaging with the larger community
- We have to go above and beyond and actually educate those that are striving to build this technology for good but may not necessarily have the resources or the institutional community wisdom to actually carry out their good intentions
- So the truth of the matter is that AI, data, and any technology that's built around that, there's a lot of great benefits to that
- It's improving the lives of many people out there
- It's enabling us to do things we couldn't ordinarily do
- It's providing us with affordances to think about other things in life
- This is all the more reason why it's important that we together, collectively, not just one organization, but the entire community, and even non-technologists, too, everyone needs to be involved
- That's the role of, that I play here, is that I try to help AI evolve ethically together, and to do that is contingent on the democratization of the responsible use of AI
