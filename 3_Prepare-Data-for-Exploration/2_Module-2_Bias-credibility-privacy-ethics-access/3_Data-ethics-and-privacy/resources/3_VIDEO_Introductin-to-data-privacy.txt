We've been exploring
some important aspects of data ethics, and one of the most personal
areas involves privacy. Privacy is personal. We may all define
privacy in our own way, and we're all entitled to it. Whether it's family
members wanting privacy when using
a shared computer, a teenager wanting to share a selfie with only
specific people, or a company wanting to keep their customers' credit
card info secure, we're all concerned how our
data is used and shared. Data privacy is big
in today's culture, so let's explore it fully. When talking about data, privacy means preserving a
data subject's information and activity any time a
data transaction occurs. This is sometimes
called information privacy or data protection. It's all about access, use, and collection of data. It also covers a person's
legal right to their data. This means someone like
you or me should have protection from unauthorized
access to our private data, freedom from inappropriate
use of our data, the right to inspect, update, or correct our data, ability to give consent
to use our data, and legal right to
access our data. For companies, it means putting privacy measures in place to protect the individuals' data. Data privacy is important, even if you're not
someone who thinks about it on a day-to-day basis. The importance of
data privacy has been recognized by governments
worldwide, and they've started creating
data protection legislation to help protect people
and their data. Being able to trust
companies with your data is important. It's what makes people want
to use a company's product, share their
information, and more. Trust is a really
big responsibility that can't be taken lightly. The final aspect involving data ethics is one that's
constantly being discussed. The idea of openness, free access, usage,
and sharing of data. We'll cover that
in another video. You're well on your
way to becoming an ethical data analyst.
