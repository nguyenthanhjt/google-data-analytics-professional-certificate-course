- Hello again
- So far, you've seen how data can be gathered and analyzed to solve all kinds of problems
- Next step, we're going to learn all about databases
- As a refresher, a database is a collection of data stored in a computer system, but storage is just the beginning
- You'll discover how databases make it possible to find the exact piece of information you need for your analysis
- You'll also learn how to sort data in order to zoom in on what you need to generate insightful reports and much more
- Then we'll go even deeper, and I mean really, really deep
- I'm talking about metadata
- You've probably heard someone say, wow that's so meta
- Usually they're talking about something referencing back to itself or being completely self aware
- For example if a character in a book knows she's in a book, that's meta
- If you make a documentary about making documentaries, that's also meta
- And here at Google, I constantly analyze how I analyze data
- That's definitely meta.
I do that to give my work a quality check to make sure my methods are fair
- And to be certain that I'm paying attention to any biases that might affect the outcome
- As an analyst, you should do this too
- Sometimes we get a little too close to our data
- So stepping back and asking ourselves if our processes make sense is key
- But let's back up just a bit and define metadata
- Metadata is data about data
- Like I said: deep.Metadata is extremely important when working with databases
- Think of it like a reference guide
- Without the guide all you have is a bunch of data with no context explaining what it means
- Metadata tells you where the data comes from, when and how it was created, and what it's all about.
Up next, you'll learn how to take data from a database or another source and bring it into a spreadsheet
- You'll do this either by importing it directly or by using SQL to generate the request
- And once you have data in a spreadsheet, the possibilities are endless
- Everything we're about to cover is a very important part of the prepare phase of the data analysis process
- It's how data analysts figure out which kind of data is going to be most helpful to them
- If you have the right data, you're much more likely to be able to solve your business problems successfully
- So, ready to tap into the incredible power of databases? Let's go!
