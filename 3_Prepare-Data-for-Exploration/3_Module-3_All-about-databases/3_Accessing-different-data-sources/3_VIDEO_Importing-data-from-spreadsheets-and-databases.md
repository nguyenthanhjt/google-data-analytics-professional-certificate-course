- At this point, you've learned all about internal and external data, and how to prepare it for use
- Now, we'll go through the process of actually importing data from different sources
- Sometimes you want to upload a spreadsheet from your files, such as a CSV file
- CSV stands for comma-separated values
- A CSV file saves data in a table format
- Now, let's bring that file into a fresh spreadsheet.
- We'll start by selecting a file, then import.
- Then we'll choose to upload a file.
- Navigate to it, open it and insert it as a new sheet.
- CSV files use plain text and they're delineated by characters
- So each column or field is clearly distinct from another when importing
- As you learned, CSVs are comma-separated, and usually the spreadsheet app will auto-detect those separations
- But sometimes, you might need to indicate that the separator is another character or a space by selecting the different options in this window.
- Also, if you are planning to work with the data set, you would usually convert to text, numbers or other options here
- But plain text is okay for reporting purposes
- So we can leave those fields alone
- Finally, select Import data.
- Now our CSV file's ready to work with in our spreadsheet
- I spend most of my time at work analyzing spreadsheets full of healthcare information
- I typically start by looking at a larger data set
- Then I pull a subset of it into a spreadsheet so I can work with it
- Maybe I want to analyze year over year growth in user demand on Google Search for certain healthcare services, like telemedicine
- Or maybe I want to look at data sets from external healthcare organizations or agencies for more insight into this trend
- For example, with telemedicine, maybe I'll look at a spreadsheet that lists telemedicine providers
- There are so many ways spreadsheets can help you find the insights you need
- One source I use a lot is the World Health Organization's data repository.
- This is a place where anybody can access open-source data
- As you can see, there's tons of data available
- You can search by theme, category, indicator and country
- You can also access World Health Organization metadata if you want to learn more about the data in the repository.
- For our example, we'll look at medical doctors by country and year.
- This information would be useful for a data analysis project looking into how many doctors are available to treat patients within a certain population compared to other populations
- To get this data, we'll start on this webpage, which contains the data set we want
- Then we'll download the data as a CSV file.
- Then open a new spreadsheet and import the file by selecting File, Import.
- Next, upload your file and select Import Data.
- After reviewing the data to make sure it looks clean, we can title it and begin our work.
- I know this is a lot of information to take in, but you'll get much more comfortable with this the more you practice
- Coming up, we'll learn how to sort and filter your data to focus on the information relevant to you.
