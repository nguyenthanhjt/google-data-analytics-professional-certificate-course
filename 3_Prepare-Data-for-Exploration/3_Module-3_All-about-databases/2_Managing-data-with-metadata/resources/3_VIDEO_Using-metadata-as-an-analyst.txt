Now that you know
what metadata is, it's time to explore why
data analysts use it. You already know that
data needs to be identified and described before it can help you solve a problem or make an effective
business decision. Putting data into
context is probably the most valuable thing
that metadata does, but there are still many more
benefits of using metadata. Here's one. Metadata creates a
single source of truth by keeping things
consistent and uniform. We data analysts
love consistency. We always aim for this kind of uniformity in our data
and our databases. After all, data that's
uniform can be organized, classified, stored, accessed,
and used effectively. Plus, when a database
is consistent, it's so much easier to discover relationships between the data inside it and the data elsewhere. Metadata also makes data
more reliable by making sure it's accurate,
precise, relevant, and timely. This also
makes it easier for data analysts to identify the root causes of any
problems that might pop up. The bottom line is, when the data we work with is high quality, it makes things easier
and improves our results. One of the ways
data analysts make sure their data is consistent and reliable is by using something called a
metadata repository. A metadata repository is a database specifically
created to store metadata. Metadata repositories
can be stored in a physical location, or
they can be virtual, like data that
exists in the cloud. These repositories describe
where metadata came from, keep it in an
accessible form so it can be used quickly and easily, and keep it in a
common structure for everyone who
may need to use it. Metadata repositories
make it easier and faster to bring together multiple
sources for data analysis. They do this by describing the state and location
of the metadata, the structure of
the tables inside, and how data flows
through the repository. They even keep track of who accesses the metadata and when. Here's a real-world example. As a health care
analyst at Google, I use second and
third party data. As you learned, second party
data is data that's collected by a group directly from
its audience and then sold. Third party data comes
from outside sources, which are not the original
collectors of that data. They get it from websites or
programs that pull the data from the various platforms where it was
originally generated. It's a bit complex, but the main thing
to remember is that third party data doesn't come from inside your own business. If my team needs to work with data that wasn't
created at Google, that means we sometimes
don't know very much about its quality
and credibility, but we need to be certain
that our data can be trusted and was
collected responsibly. After all, if the data is unreliable, our results
can be unreliable too. That's why understanding
the metadata of the external database
is so important. It lets us confirm that
the data is clean, accurate, relevant, and timely. This is particularly important if the data comes from
another organization. One other important
step when working with external data is confirming
that we're allowed to use it. We'll often reach out
to the owner to make sure we can access
or purchase it. To sum up, metadata repositories are useful for all these reasons. Plus, they help ensure
that my team is pulling the right content for the particular project and
using it appropriately. We can confirm this because
the metadata clearly describes how and when
the data was collected, how it's organized,
and much more. Soon you'll learn
even more about using metadata in data analytics, and if you're finding metadata
particularly fascinating, you'll discover some really
exciting career choices that focus on
metadata. Stay tuned.
