Welcome back in this task We're going to finish helping our
client decide where to purchase office space for their
business.
In the last task we added a second selection criteria to the
where clause.
By the end of this task we will add a third criteria to our
SQL statement.
We will narrow down our results even further by selecting
cities based on their happiness ranking.
Our client wants to move to a city that is in the top
15 happiest cities in the world.
Let's help them out with that.
This time you're going to work on your own so you can apply
what you've learned so far to solve a problem.
But before you do, note that the values in the happiness
ranking our interviews with one being the happiest. Your
client wants to be in the top 15 happiest cities.
So that means these cities have a happiness ranking
of 15 or less.
You can always check the schema which is the structure
of the table.
To confirm the name of the column
you will want to use in your SQL statement.
Now pause the instructional video and add this new happiness
condition to your SQL statement.
When you're done, resume the video and we will go
over the solution together.
Welcome back,  the column
we're interested in the one that specifies the happiness
ranking is titled happiness underscore ranking.
We can simply add another criteria to our wear clause to do
this. Press into then begin with the keyword AND happiness
underscore ranking less than equals 15. Notice we use
less than and equal to because we want to include cities that
are ranked number 15 and all the values that are less than 15.
Now you're ready to run this query for us to run option.
Way to go!
We have narrowed our candidates even further.
Our results now only show cities that match our client's
requirements around temperature commute times and happiness.
Now let's summarize what we did in this last task.
Our goal for this task was to narrow down our results even
further by selecting cities based on the happiness ranking.
In the process we learned that to further narrow
down the number of cities in our search, we needed to add
another criterion to our where clause as a result by the end
of this task we identified two cities that match our clients
ideal temperature requirements, commute time requirements
and happiness ranking criteria that would have taken a lot
of time to build manually but it was made so much easier
with the use of SQL and BigQuery.
That is why for data analyst role, SQL continues to be
one of the most in-demand skills. With that,
I hope you enjoyed this project. With this new found SQL
skills, you are now one step closer to a career as a data
analyst.
There is an optional practice task after this task.
