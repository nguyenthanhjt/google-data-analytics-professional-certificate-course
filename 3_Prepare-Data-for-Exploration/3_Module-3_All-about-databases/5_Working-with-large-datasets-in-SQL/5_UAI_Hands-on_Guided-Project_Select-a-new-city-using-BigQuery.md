# Hands-on Guided Project: Select a New City Using BigQuery

## About Guided Projects

In this Guided Project, you will be assigned a cloud desktop that has the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along with the instructor to complete the project's tasks.

You will work side-by-side with an industry expert to help a fictional client select a new city for their offices. To do this, you will apply your knowledge of SQL to query a database and filter a large dataset.

After completing this project, you can reference a summary of the key takeaways from this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19wbItlTSb111sQPhjF-AxjVksnRnsQTO32MEC6jBBvI/template/preview).
