- Hi.
- Welcome back.
- Throughout this course, you've seen how BigQuery can be used to view and analyze data from tons of sources.
- Now we're going to explore the different account tiers that BigQuery offers, so you know how to choose the right one for your needs, and how you can access them.
- BigQuery is offered to you at no charge.
- There are paid options available, but we won't need them for the activities in this course.
- Instead, we're going to talk about two account types: sandbox, and free trial.
- A Sandbox account is available at no charge and anyone with a Google account can log in and use it.
- There are a couple of limitations to this account type.
- For example, you get a maximum of 12 projects at a time.
- This means that if you want to make a 13th project, you'll have to delete one of your original 12.
- It also doesn't allow you to insert new records to a database or update the field values of existing records.
- These Data Manipulation Language or DML operations aren't supported in the sandbox.
- However, you won't need to do this in course activities.
- You can read more about the limitations of a sandbox account in the BigQuery documentation.
- This is the account type we'll use for most of our activities.
- It's simple to set up.
- So, later in this video we'll walk through the steps required to create an account.
- Before that though, we should talk about the other way to use BigQuery without charges.
- The Google Cloud free trial.
- The free trial gives you access to more of what BigQuery has to offer with fewer overall limitations.
- The free trial offers $300 in credit for use in Google Cloud during the first 90 days.
- You won't get anywhere near that spending limit if you just use the BigQuery console to practice SQL queries.
- After you spend the $300 credit or after 90 days, your free trial will expire and you will need to personally select to upgrade to a paid account to keep working in Google Cloud.
- Your method of payment will not be automatically charged after your free trial ends.
- The free trial does require that you set up a payment option with Google Cloud.
- But unless you choose to opt-in for an account upgrade, it won't charge you.
- However, it does require you to enter a payment type.
- So, we understand if you don't feel comfortable with this option.
- This is one reason the BigQuery sandbox account exists, so you don't have to enter any payment information.
- With either type of account, you can upgrade to a paid account at anytime and retain all of your existing projects.
- If you set up a free trial account but choose not to upgrade to a paid account when your trial period ends, you can set up a free sandbox account at that time.
- However, projects from your trial won't transfer to your sandbox.
- It would be like starting from scratch.
- Just something to keep in mind.
- Now we're going to set up your sandbox account, which you can change into a free trial or upgrade to a paid account if you choose.
- First, we'll go to the BigQuery sandbox documentation page.
- Then go to the upper right corner and log in to whichever Google account you want to use for the BigQuery sandbox account.
- Then we'll select the "Go to BigQuery" button on the documentation page.
- This gives us a drop-down to select a country and to read the terms of service agreement.
- This will bring us to the SQL workspace, which we'll be using an upcoming activities.
- Choose "Create Project" and name the project and give it an ID.
- Choose "Create," and then "Done." There we have it.
- In the next video, we'll explore what each part of the SQL workspace does and how we'll use it in future activities.
- See you there.
