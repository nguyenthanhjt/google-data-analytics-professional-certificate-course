# Self-Reflection: Considering databases and spreadsheets for sorting and filtering

## Overview

Now that you have sorted and filtered data in a spreadsheet and have been introduced to databases, you can pause for a moment and think about what you are learning. In this self-reflection, you will consider your thoughts about spreadsheets and databases, then respond to brief questions.

This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to apply your knowledge of data preparation to real-world situations. As you answer questions—and come up with questions of your own—you will consider concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You’ve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

## Compare and contrast

Think about everything you’ve learned about spreadsheets and databases. In many ways, they are similar. In other ways, they are different.
For example, both spreadsheets and databases store and organize data. However, databases can be relational while spreadsheets cannot. This means that spreadsheets are better-suited to self-contained data, where the data exists in one place. Meanwhile, you can use databases to store data from external tables, allowing you to change data in several places by editing in only one place.

Take a moment to consider these examples and come up with a few of your own. Here are some areas you may want to consider:

- How do they store data?
- How are they used to interact with data?
- How powerful is each?
- What are their pros and cons when sorting?
- What are their pros and cons when filtering?

As you consider each of these questions, compile them into a simple table. You can use pen and paper or your preferred spreadsheet software. Add the question on the left, and compare and contrast spreadsheets and databases on the right. Your table may look something like this:

|Question|Spreadsheet|Database|
|--------|-----------|--------|
|How do they store data?|Stores data in cells.|Stores data in tables.|
|How are they used to interact with data?|Open file with Google Sheets or MS Excel|Use SQL to query in the Database|
|How powerful is each?|Easy to access when having the spreadsheet file or link. Can handle moderate-sized datasets effectively. | More powerful for handling large datasets and complex relationships. Enables data integrity and security. |
|What are their pros and cons when sorting?| Pros: User-friendly interface for simple sorting. Cons: Limited scalability for extensive sorting tasks. |Pros: Efficient sorting capabilities for large datasets. Cons: Learning curve for complex sorting operations. |
|What are their pros and cons when filtering?| Pros: Quick and intuitive filtering for smaller datasets. Cons: Limited filtering options for intricate criteria.| Pros: Advanced filtering using SQL queries, suitable for complex filtering conditions. Cons: Requires SQL proficiency. |

Use your table to compare and contrast. When you’re done, answer the reflection questions below.

## Reflection

Consider what you’ve learned while comparing spreadsheets and databases in this reflection:

- What similarities have you noticed between spreadsheets and databases? What differences?
- Think about how it felt to learn about each topic. Was one easier or harder to learn than the other? If so, why do you think so?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.

### My reflection

- Similarities and Differences:
  - Both spreadsheets and databases store and organize data, but databases are relational and excel in managing data from external tables.
  - Spreadsheets are self-contained, while databases enable centralized editing for data distributed across multiple places.
Learning Experience:
- Learning about spreadsheets and databases felt complementary, each offering unique strengths. Spreadsheets were more intuitive initially, but databases provided a deeper understanding of data management and relationships.

> Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! A good reflection on this topic would include how sheets in spreadsheets are both similar to and different from tables in databases.
Data analysts use many forms of data throughout day-to-day work. For instance, an analyst might use a spreadsheet for one project but use a database for another. A company might use a spreadsheet to track internal revenue data, but might use a database to store dynamic consumer info. Understanding which type is appropriate to use in a specific situation is crucial to being an effective data analyst. In upcoming activities, you will learn more about databases and how they differ from spreadsheets.
