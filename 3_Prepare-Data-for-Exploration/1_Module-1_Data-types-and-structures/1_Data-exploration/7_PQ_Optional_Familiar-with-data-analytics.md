# Optional: Familiar with data analytics? Take our diagnostic quiz

Optional speed track for those experienced in data analytics

The Google Data Analytics Certificate provides instruction and feedback for learners hoping to earn a position as an entry-level data analyst. While many learners will be brand new to the world of data analytics, others may be familiar with the field and simply wanting to brush up on certain skills.

If you believe this course will be primarily a refresher for you, we recommend taking this practice diagnostic quiz. It will enable you to determine if you should follow the speed track, which is an opportunity to proceed to Course 4 after taking each of the Course 3 Weekly Challenges and the overall Course Challenge. Learners who earn 100% on the diagnostic quiz can treat Course 3 videos, readings, and activities as optional.  Learners following the speed track are still able to earn the certificate.
