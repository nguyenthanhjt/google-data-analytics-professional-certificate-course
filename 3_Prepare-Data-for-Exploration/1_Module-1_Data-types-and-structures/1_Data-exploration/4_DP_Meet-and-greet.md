# Meet and greet

While solving a mystery, a detective sometimes asks a big, critical question at the beginning of their investigation, then follows up with smaller questions. Other times, the detective starts with smaller questions, which lead to a big, critical question at the end. Either way, the mystery is solved!

For this discussion, consider the following questions:
    - What kind of data detective are you?
    - Do you tend to come up with a big question first?
    - Do you prefer to ask small questions and let them lead you to the big question?

Please write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing your thoughts about being a data detective. In your response, include your preferred style of questioning. Then, visit the [discussion forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/discussions) to read what other learners have written, and engage in discussion about at least two posts.

- Being a data detective is about navigating the intricate pathways of information to unravel insights. Personally, I lean towards starting with a big question that sets the overarching purpose of my analysis. This helps in maintaining focus and aligning the investigation with specific goals. However, I appreciate the beauty of asking small questions, akin to following a trail of breadcrumbs. These incremental queries often lead to unexpected discoveries and refine the scope of the analysis. Both approaches have their merits, and the choice depends on the context of the data mystery at hand. I look forward to exploring the diverse perspectives of fellow learners in the discussion forum.
- As a data detective, my preferred style of questioning is to start with smaller questions and let them guide me towards the big, critical question. I believe that by delving into specific aspects of the data and understanding the nuances, I can gradually build a comprehensive picture that leads to the overarching question. This approach allows me to uncover hidden patterns, identify anomalies, and gradually piece together the puzzle. By exploring smaller questions, I can iteratively refine my understanding and ensure that the big question is framed in a way that captures the essence of the data mystery. This method aligns with my belief in the importance of a meticulous and detail-oriented approach to data analysis. I look forward to reading about the diverse strategies and perspectives of fellow data detectives in the discussion forum.
