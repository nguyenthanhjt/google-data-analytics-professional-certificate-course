- Picture this: You're working on a project.
- You've asked all the right questions, applied structured thinking, and you're completely in sync with your stakeholders.
- You're off to a great start.
- But there's another step in the process: preparing the data correctly.
- This is where understanding the different types of data and data structures comes in.
- Knowing this lets you figure out what type of data is right for the question you're answering.
- Plus, you'll gain practical skills about how to extract, use, organize, and protect your data.
- Hey, my name is Hallie, and I'm an analytical lead at Google.
- I work with companies in the healthcare industry.
- I'm so excited to welcome you to this course.
- You've been building up your data analyst skills in lots of different ways so far.
- You've learned how to ask the right questions, define the problem, and present your analysis in a way that matches up with the needs of your stakeholders.
- In other words, you've learned how to tell a story using data.
Now we'll learn more about the data that you'll need to tell the best story possible.
- But before we do that, I'd love to tell you my story.
- I use analytics to help healthcare companies develop digital marketing solutions that make their business and their brands stronger.
- My team and I find business and media opportunities based on the latest industry and data insights.
- I've been working in healthcare for about five years, and it's great.
- I really enjoy being able to use data to help spark change in such an important industry.
- As you'll discover in this course, data can be the main character in a very powerful story.
- I absolutely love using analysis to tell that story in a way that's compelling and informative.
Here's a real life example of how I've used data to tell a story.
- In my job, we analyze Medicare enrollment data over time and make connections to how people research Medicare plans on Google.
- As people 65 and older become more informed decision makers for their health, I use the data to learn if there's an increase in Medicare enrollments and what part Google searches play if there is an increase in demand.
- Now it's very important that I make sure the data is relevant and valid.
- I also have to pay attention to questions around access and equity while maintaining the privacy of those conducting searches.
- The happy ending of my story is that the data in my findings is useful to medical professionals and their patients.
- There's so much useful data out there, and you're building the skills you'll need to find and use the right data in the best way.
- In this course, you'll continue sharpening those skills.
- So you've already heard a lot about the data analysis process steps: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.
- Now it's time to learn how to prepare the data.
- You'll learn to identify how data is generated and collected, and you'll explore different formats, types and structures of data.
- We'll make sure you know how to choose and use data that'll help you understand and respond to a business problem.
- And because not all data fits each need, you'll learn how to analyze data for bias and credibility.
- We'll also explore what clean data means.
- But wait, there's more.
- You'll also get up close and personal with databases.
- We'll cover what they are and how analysts use them.
- You'll even get to extract your own data from a database using a couple of tools that you're already familiar with: spreadsheets and SQL.
The key here is patience.
- Like anything worth doing, this will take time and practice.
- And I'll be with you every step of the way.
- Still with me? Great.
- The last few things we'll cover are the basics of data organization and the process of protecting your data.
- Data works best when it's organized.
- And if you're organizing your data, you'll want to protect it too.
- I'll show you how to do both and apply it to your own analysis.
- I'm so excited to help you write your own personal story as you continue exploring the world of data analytics.
- So let's do it.
