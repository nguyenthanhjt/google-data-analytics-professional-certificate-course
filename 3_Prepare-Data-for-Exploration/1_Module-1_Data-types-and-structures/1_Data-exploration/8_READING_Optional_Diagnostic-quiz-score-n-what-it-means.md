# Optional: Your diagnostic quiz score and what it means

Use your score to help you determine whether you should take the speed track. The speed track allows you to skip over the lesson material and go straight to the weekly challenges and the course challenge, which lead to your final course score. In order to earn your certificate, you will need an overall score of 80% or higher on all graded materials in this program. Read on to figure out your next steps based on your quiz score:

- If you scored 100% on the diagnostic quiz:
  - You’re probably very familiar with types of data and data structures and can take the speed track to move on to Course 4.
  - You must take each of the weekly challenges and the course challenge, which will count toward the 80% overall score needed to earn the - certificate. To help you find these items more quickly, we’ve identified them with asterisks in the course materials (for example: *course - challenge*).
  - After you complete the weekly challenges and course challenge, proceed to Course 4.
  - You’re welcome to review videos, readings, and activities throughout the course based on your interests.
- If you scored between 90% and 99% on the diagnostic quiz:
  - You’re probably familiar with the types of data and data structures and might consider taking the speed track to move on to Course 4.
  - However, we still recommend that you go through the Course 3 lesson materials to review areas where you might have some gaps before proceeding - to Course 4.
