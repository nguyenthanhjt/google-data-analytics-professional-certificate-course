You probably use the words "wide" and
"long" all the time. You might use "wide" to describe the size
of something from side to side, like a wide river. But a river can also
travel great distances, so you might call it "long" as well. Wait! Before you stop the video, I promise you didn't accidentally
click in the wrong course. I'm not here to teach you words you
already know. But the words "wide" and "long" can be used to describe data, too. So I am here to help you understand
wide data and long data. So far you've dealt with data
arranged mostly in a wide format. With wide data, every data subject has
a single row with multiple columns to hold the values of various
attributes of the subject. Here's some wide data in a spreadsheet. You might remember we discussed this
data about the population of Latin and Caribbean countries earlier. For this data set, each row provides all
of the population information about one country. Each column shows
the population for a different year. Wide data lets you easily identify and
quickly compare different columns. In our example, the data is arranged
alphabetically by country, so you can compare the annual populations
of Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, and the Bahamas by just checking
out the values in each column. The wide data format also
makes it easy to find and compare the countries' populations
at different periods of time. For example, by sorting the data, we discover that Brazil had the highest
population of all countries in 2010, and the British Virgin Islands had the lowest
population of all countries in 2013. Okay, now let's explore
this data in a long format. Here the data is no longer
organized into columns by year. All the years are now in one column with
each country, like Argentina, appearing in multiple rows, one for each year of data. This is how long data usually looks. Long data is data in which each row
is one time point per subject, so each subject will have
data in multiple rows. Our spreadsheet is formatted to show
each year of population data. Here we see Antigua and Barbuda first. Long data is a great format for storing
and organizing data when there's multiple variables for each subject at each
time point that we want to observe. With this long data format,
we can store and analyze all of this data using fewer
columns. Plus, if we added a new variable, like the average age of a population,
we'd only need one more column. If we'd use a wide data format instead, we
would have needed 10 more columns, one for each year. The long data format keeps
everything nice and compact. If you're wondering which
format you should use, the simple answer is, "it depends." Sometimes you'll have to transform
wide data into a long data format, or other times vice versa. You'll probably work with
both formats in your job. And you'll definitely revisit both
formats again later in this program. That reminds me: earlier we define
data as a collection of facts. As you've discovered over the last few
videos, that collection of facts can take on lots of different formats,
structures, types, and more. Learning about all of the ways that
data can be presented will be a big help to you throughout the data
analysis process. The more you work with
data in all its forms, the quicker you'll start to recognize
which data to use, and when to use it. And in just a bit, you'll use all that data stored in your
brain to help you take an assessment. After that, you'll learn how to
identify and avoid bias in data and how to embrace credibility,
integrity and ethics. The data adventure moves forward.
I'm so glad you're moving with it!
