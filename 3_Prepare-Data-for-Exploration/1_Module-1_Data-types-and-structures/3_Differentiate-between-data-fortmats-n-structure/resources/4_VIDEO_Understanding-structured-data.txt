Hi, great to see you again! Earlier, we compared some data formats,
including structured and unstructured data. Most of the data being generated
right now is actually unstructured. Audio files, video files,
emails, photos, and social media are all examples
of unstructured data. These can be harder to analyze
in their unstructured format. But here's the good news, you'll be working with structured
data most of the time. For example, if you need to analyze data
about the unstructured data in emails, photos, and social media sites, it'll most likely be structured for
analysis before you even get to it. Because of that, I want to explore
structured data a bit more. As a quick refresher, structured data is
data organized in a format like rows and columns. But there's definitely
more to it than that. Structured data works nicely within a data
model, which is a model that is used for organizing data elements and
how they relate to one another. What are data elements? They're pieces of information,
such as people's names, account numbers, and addresses. Data models help to keep
data consistent and provide a map of how data is organized. This makes it easier for analysts and other stakeholders to make sense of their
data and use it for business purposes. In addition to working well within data
models, structured data is also useful for databases. This makes it easy for
analysts to enter, query, and analyze the data whenever they need to. This also helps make data
visualization pretty easy because structured data can be applied
directly to charts, graphs, heat maps, dashboards and most other
visual representations of data. Alright, so now we know
that spreadsheets and databases that store data sets are widely
used sources of structured data. After you explore some
other data structures, you'll check out more data
types using a spreadsheet. The adventure continues!
