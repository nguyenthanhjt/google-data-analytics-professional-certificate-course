- Hi, great to see you again! Earlier, we compared some data formats, including structured and unstructured data.
- Most of the data being generated right now is actually unstructured.
- Audio files, video files, emails, photos, and social media are all examples of unstructured data.
- These can be harder to analyze in their unstructured format.
- But here's the good news, you'll be working with structured data most of the time.
- For example, if you need to analyze data about the unstructured data in emails, photos, and social media sites, it'll most likely be structured for analysis before you even get to it.
- Because of that, I want to explore structured data a bit more.
- As a quick refresher, structured data is data organized in a format like rows and columns.
- But there's definitely more to it than that.
- Structured data works nicely within a data model, which is a model that is used for organizing data elements and how they relate to one another.
- What are data elements? They're pieces of information, such as people's names, account numbers, and addresses.
- Data models help to keep data consistent and provide a map of how data is organized.
- This makes it easier for analysts and other stakeholders to make sense of their data and use it for business purposes.
- In addition to working well within data models, structured data is also useful for databases.
- This makes it easy for analysts to enter, query, and analyze the data whenever they need to.
- This also helps make data visualization pretty easy because structured data can be applied directly to charts, graphs, heat maps, dashboards and most other visual representations of data.
- Alright, so now we know that spreadsheets and databases that store data sets are widely used sources of structured data.
- After you explore some other data structures, you'll check out more data types using a spreadsheet.
- The adventure continues!

## Keypoints

Structured vs. Unstructured Data:

- Most data generated is unstructured, including audio files, video files, emails, photos, and social media.
- Structured data, organized in rows and columns, is more common in data analysis tasks.

Structured Data Characteristics:

- Organized in a format like rows and columns for ease of analysis.
- Fits well within a data model, which organizes data elements and their relationships.
- Data models help maintain consistency and provide a map of how data is organized.

Data Models and Elements:

- Data models are used for organizing data elements, such as names, account numbers, and addresses.
- Data models assist in keeping data consistent and provide a framework for understanding.

Structured Data and Databases:

- Structured data is well-suited for databases, allowing for easy data entry, querying, and analysis.
- Enables seamless integration into various visual representations like charts, graphs, and dashboards.

Usability in Data Visualization:

- Structured data is conducive to data visualization techniques, enhancing its presentation in visual forms.
- Easily applied to charts, graphs, heat maps, and other visual representations of data.

Key Sources of Structured Data:

- Spreadsheets and databases are widely used sources of structured data.
- Analysts frequently work with structured data derived from unstructured sources for analysis.

Continued Exploration:

- The exploration of structured data continues as analysts delve into various data structures and types.
- The adventure includes examining data sets using spreadsheets and databases.
