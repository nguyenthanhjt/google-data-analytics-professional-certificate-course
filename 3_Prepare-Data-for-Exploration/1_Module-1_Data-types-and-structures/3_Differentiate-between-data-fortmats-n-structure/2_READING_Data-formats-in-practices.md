# Data formats in practice

When you think about the word "format," a lot of things might come to mind. Think of an advertisement for your favorite store. You might find it in the form of a print ad, a billboard, or even a commercial. The information is presented in the format that works best for you to take it in. The format of a dataset is a lot like that, and choosing the right format will help you manage and use your data in the best way possible.
