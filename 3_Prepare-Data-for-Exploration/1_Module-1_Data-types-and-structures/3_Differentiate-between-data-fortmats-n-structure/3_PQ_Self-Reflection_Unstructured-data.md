# Self-Reflection: Unstructured data

## Overview

Now that you have learned about unstructured data, you can pause for a moment and apply what you are learning. In this self-reflection, you will complete tasks with a neural network, consider your thoughts about data structuring, and respond to brief questions.

This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to apply your knowledge of data structures to your interactions with unstructured data. As you complete tasks with a neural network website, you will explore concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You’ve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

## Data structuring with Quick, Draw

In this self-reflection, you will explore the nature of unstructured data through a crowd-sourced dataset.

**Quick, Draw!** is a neural network dataset that has millions of pictures drawn by people separated into categories like plants, animals, or vehicles. On the Quick, Draw! website, you can view a large dataset of hundreds of thousands of real doodles made by people on the internet. You can also draw your own. Through this process, you can train a neural network to recognize objects and learn more about the importance of structured data.

1. Visit the [Quick, Draw! website](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/cloud)
2. In the upper left-hand corner, you will notice a drop-down menu like this:

Select a type of doodle to begin.

3. Click on different pictures to see details about the images on your screen. For example, there are more than one hundred thousand different drawings of elephants. Scroll through the list and see if there are any that don’t belong. If you find one that doesn’t match the intended object, click on it and select Flag as inappropriate.
4. Explore other categories of drawings. Select three categories that interest you and check out their doodles.
5. Optional: Explore further. Click Get the data to visit the GitHub page containing the entire dataset. As you become more familiar with data projects and start creating your own, you can return to this dataset and analyze it yourself. Click Play the game to draw your own doodles and contribute to Quick, Draw!’s dataset.
6. When you’re done, answer the reflection questions below.

## Reflection

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.
Your answer cannot be more than 10000 characters.

1. Consider the doodles you found in the Quick, Draw! Dataset:

- What do you notice as you explored drawings in different categories? Are there consistent themes among the pictures in a category?
  - While exploring different categories, I noticed consistent themes among pictures within a category. Drawings in the same category exhibited recognizable patterns and shared visual characteristics, contributing to a cohesive theme for each category.
- If you didn’t know the category labels, how would you distinguish the pictures from each other? What would you look for?
  - Without category labels, I would distinguish pictures based on visual elements, shapes, and recurring patterns. The distinctive features, such as shapes or common structures, would be key identifiers to differentiate between the pictures.

2. Consider what you know about structured and unstructured data and how it connects to the Quick, Draw! website:

- How would you describe the Quick, Draw! doodles you explored from a data point of view?
  - From the data point of view, [The Quick, Draw!] doodles represent unstructured data. Each drawing is an individual and varied representation of an object, lacking a standardized format. The data lacks a clear organizational structure, making it more challenging to analyze systematically.
- How are these doodles different from or similar to other types of data that you have previously encountered?
  - These doodles differ from structured data, such as tables or spreadsheets, as they lack a predefined format. In contrast to numerical or categorical data, the drawings are diverse, subjective, and not easily organized into rows and columns. They share similarities with other unstructured data like images or text, representing real-world variability.
- What about this data makes it unstructured?
  - The unstructured nature of this data arises from the absence of a standardized format or predefined categories. Each doodle is a unique representation, with no uniformity in size, shape, or style. This lack of organization makes it unstructured, requiring more sophisticated analysis methods than structured data.
