# Video: Compelling presentation tips

Video transcript

- Businesses everywhere know the power of using data to solve problems and achieve goals.
- But all the data in the world won't get you anywhere if your stakeholders can't understand it or if they can't stay focused on what you're telling them.
- So you want to create presentations that are logically organized, interesting, and communicate your key messages clearly.
- An effective presentation supports your narrative by making it more interesting than words alone.
- It starts with how you want to organize your data insights.
- The narrative you share with your stakeholders needs characters, a setting, a plot, a big reveal, and an "aha moment," just like any other story.
- The characters are the people affected by your story.
- This could be your stakeholders, customers, clients, and others.
- When adding information about your characters to your story, you have a great opportunity to include a personal account and bring more human context to the facts that the data has revealed—think about why they care.
- Next up is a setting, which describes what's going on, how often it's happening, what tasks are involved, and other background information about the data project that describes the current situation.
- The plot, sometimes called the conflict, is what creates tension in the current situation.
- This could be a challenge from a competitor, an inefficient process that needs to be fixed, or a new opportunity that the company just can't pass up.
- This complication of the current situation should reveal the problem your analysis is solving and compel the characters to act.
- The big reveal, or resolution, is how the data has shown that you can solve the problem the characters are facing by becoming more competitive, improving a process, inventing a new system, or whatever the ultimate goal of your data project may be.
- Finally, your "aha moment" is when you share your recommendations and explain why you think they'll help your company be successful.
- When I'm working on a presentation, this is where I like to start, too.
- Using these basic elements to outline your presentation could be a great place to start, and they can help you organize your findings into a clear story.
- And once you decided on these five key parts of your story, it's time to think about how to pair your narrative with interesting visuals because as you're learning, an interesting and persuasive data story needs interesting and persuasive visuals.
- Coming up, you'll learn even more about how to be an expert data storyteller.
