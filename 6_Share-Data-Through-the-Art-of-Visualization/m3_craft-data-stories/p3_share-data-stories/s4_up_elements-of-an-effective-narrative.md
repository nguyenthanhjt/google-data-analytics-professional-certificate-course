Putting it all together:elements of an effective narrative

Libby is a data analyst for a home improvement store. As she creates an important upcoming presentation, review scenarios and identify which of the five elements of storytelling correspond to each.

## Scenario 1

Libby finds that supply issues cut inventory across the entire U.S. market last year, but these problems are almost resolved in the supply chain. Demand is stronger than ever, and the company has a big opportunity to run marketing campaigns to highlight the availability and new lower price of lumber before their competitors.

Elements of data storytelling:

- Characters
- Plot
- `Big reveal`

> The Big reveal is how data solves the problem. Here, a timely marketing campaign could increase lumber sales.

## Scenario 2

Moving forward, Libby suggests that the company should run a three-day sale on lumber across all U.S. stores within the next two weeks to signal lumber availability. Libby also encourages the team to closely monitor sales and measure the consumer sentiment driving demand to inform other future large- and small-scale marketing campaigns.
