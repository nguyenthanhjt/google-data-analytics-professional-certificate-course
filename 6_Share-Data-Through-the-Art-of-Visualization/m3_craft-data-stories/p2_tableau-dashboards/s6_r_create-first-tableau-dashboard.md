# Create your first Tableau dashboard

You're going to take what you've learned about data visualizations and create a dashboard.

Tableau contains tons of other functionality to build dashboards that update in real time and include interactive visualizations.

Dashboards are important in data analysis because they enable people to visualize data in dynamic and interactive ways, which can help enhance what you can do with your data presentations. Data visualizations are most useful when they are presented in a dashboard style format to stakeholders because dashboards put all the key information in the same place, making it easier to understand what's really important. Many dashboards also constantly update to reflect new data and can be interactive. No matter what style of dashboard you choose, they can help you present your data to stakeholders in an impactful way.

## Open Tableau

You'll need to navigate and sign-in to the [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) online app. You may also refer back to the reading on how to create an account, a profile, loading, and linking datasets using the Tableau public app - [Using Tableau Public](../../m2_create-data-visualizations-with-tableau/p1_get-started-with-tableau/s8_r_optional_using-tableau-desktop.md).

## Accessing the Dataset

Click on the link to create your own copy of the [CO2 Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1LwGHDgJkXSm8b0ziSDyC8pQGqjYVGpX9mAEVPs2KQgY/copy).

If you do not have a Google account, you may directly download the CO2 dataset by clicking below:

[CO2-Dataset.xlsx](./resources/c6-m3-p2-s6_CO2-Dataset.xlsx)

## Load the Dataset

Now that you have logged into Tableau Public, access the data source dashboard by clicking on the **Create tab**, then the **Web Authoring** option at the top of the landing page. Next, click on the center button, **Upload from computer**, and select the CO2 Dataset that has been downloaded to your device.

Once the dataset has been loaded, direct your attention to the bottom of the data source tabs in the bottom left corner of the window. This opens the data sources folder Tableau public has created on your machine by default. Going forward, you should save any datasets you're working with to the data sources folder. Keeping your data files in one place is a best practice that will keep you organized.

Make a note that all of the tabs within the dataset are arranged into a vertical toolbar on the left side of the page.

Drag the Sheet titled CO2 Data Cleaned from the left bar to the middle of the page and click on the button Update Automatically option after dragging the sheet icon.

Navigate back to the tab titled Sheet 1 at the bottom of the page and click on it. At this point, a new window with a vertical dashboard titled Tables will appear.

Drag the green # Year icon to the Columns box located at the top of the page.

Drag the green # CO2 (kt) icon to the Rows box located at the top of the page.

Drag the blue Abc Region icon to the Colors icon containing the 4-colored dots.

You have now created your first basic timeline dashboard, which indicates the level of CO2 (kilotons) emitted by the various parts of the globe from 1960 to 2012.

You may also do a preliminary analysis of the number of categories, rows, data ranges, and any null values that appear in the data source page. This will give you a sense of more dashboard types and styles that can be generated from the dataset.
