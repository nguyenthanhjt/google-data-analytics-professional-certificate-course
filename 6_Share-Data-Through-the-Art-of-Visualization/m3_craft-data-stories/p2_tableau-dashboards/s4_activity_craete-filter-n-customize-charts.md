# Practice Quiz: Hands-On Activity: Create, filter, and customize charts

You‘ve learned that you can create charts in spreadsheets and in Tableau and that information can be customized using filters. Before working in Tableau, you will work with a spreadsheet chart editor. This will allow you to create visualizations to draw insights from immediately—and will help you start thinking about how to make design choices in more complex tools.

By the time you complete this activity, you will be able to create a chart in a spreadsheet and customize it by using filters and applying different styles. This will enable you to use spreadsheets in another helpful way, which is important for using all the tools at your disposal in your career as a data analyst.

### Step 2: Create a chart in a spreadsheet

**Important note:** The following steps are for Google Sheets, but they can help guide you to similar features in Excel. Refer to the Additional resources section if you need more specific instructions for creating charts in Excel.

1. In the spreadsheet that you copied or downloaded, practice creating a chart by selecting the second tab named Create your chart here. This tab contains the total purchases calculated for each store from the first tab. All of the original data is preserved in the first tab so you can explore chart creation in the second tab without changing or deleting any of the original data.

2. Select to highlight cells **B4 through C7** as the data for your chart.

3. From the main menu, select **Insert**, and select **Chart**.

   - The **Insert** menu is opened, showing Chart as the fifth option on the list.

4. A chart is created automatically, and the **Chart editor** pane opens on the right so you can change the chart type. If a pie chart is displayed, select the **Chart type** dropdown list and then select a **Column chart** so your chart matches the one below. Based on the data selected, you should also get a title like the one shown.

    ![A column chart titled, Total Purchases versus store name shows four vertical bars of varying heights, one for each store. Bars represent Candy’s Beauty Supply, Rockland’s, Rudiger Pharmacy, and Elizabethtown Supply.](./resources/img-2.png)

5. In the Setup section of the Chart editor, below X-axis, select the three dots menu and then select **Add labels**. Make sure the range B4:B7 is indicated to the left of the three dots, and after you select the **Add labels** option, verify that the data columns display a vertical label on each column.

    ![In the chart editor, clicking the 3 vertical dots to the right of the X-axis name allows you to Remove the name, or Add label.](./resources/img-3.png)

6. To filter the data shown in the column chart, select the pink header row (row 3) and then select the **filter** icon in the toolbar. This adds a filter icon on each column of your data.

   - Alternatively, you can use the Data menu and select **Create a filter** after selecting cells B3:C3.

    ![The Data menu is opened, showing Create a filter as the third option on the list.](./resources/img-4.png)

7. Select the filter icon for the Store Name column and uncheck Candy's Beauty Supply.

    ![The Filter menu is opened, showing options to Sort, either alphabetically or by color, and Filter, by color, condition, or values. Below these options, a list of the store names allows you to check or uncheck each, allowing you to show each on the chart or not](./resources/img-5.png)

8. Select OK and your chart will automatically update to exclude the data for Candy's Beauty Supply, as shown below.

    ![The chart now has three vertical bars, and formatting has been adjusted to show these as the complete data for the chart.](./resources/img-8.png)

   **Note:** To include the data for Candy's Beauty Supply again, simply select the filter icon for Store Name and then select the Candy's Beauty Supply checkbox to add it back to the chart.

### Step 3: Apply styles

You can also apply different styles to the chart. For example, the default blue in the chart isn't the most appropriate for accessibility when the background is white.

1. Double-click the chart to open the **Chart editor** pane.

2. If necessary, in the **Chart editor** pane, select **Series** to expand the options.

    ![Series options include fill color, fill opacity, line color, line opacity, line dash type, and line thickness.](./resources/img-9.png)

3. Below Format, from the Fill color dropdown list, select Custom.

    ![x](./resources/img-10.png)

4. Change the Hex value for the color to one of the blue hues recommended for use on white backgrounds for accessibility. Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh's [Web accessibility guidelines](http://web-accessibility.carnegiemuseums.org/design/color/) are an example of web accessibility guidelines.

   - `#0071bc`
   - `#046b99`
   - `#205493`
   - ![x](./resources/img-11.png)

   - A palette of a single blue hue shows variations of that blue from nearly white through blue to nearly black. Fields below allow you to enter a Hex value, in this case 0071bc. There are also three fields that allow you to enter values for red, blue, and green to specify a color.

5. Select OK, and the chart will automatically update with the newly assigned color.
