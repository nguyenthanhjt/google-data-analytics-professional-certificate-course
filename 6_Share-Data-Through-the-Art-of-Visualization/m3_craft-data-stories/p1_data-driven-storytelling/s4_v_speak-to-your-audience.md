# Video: Speak to your audience

Video transcrit

- Welcome back.
- When you want to communicate something to others, a great story can help you reach people's hearts and minds and make them more open to what you have to say.
- In other words, stories make people care.
- As you learned before, the first of the three data storytelling steps teach us that for a story to be successful, you need to focus on who's listening.
- Data analysts do this by making sure that they're engaging their audience.
- That's what we'll explore together now.
- First, you need to know your audience.
- Think back to the example of telling someone a joke they've heard many times before and expecting them to laugh at the punchline.
- Not likely.
- To get the response you're seeking, you've got to understand your audience's point of view.
- That means thinking about how your data project might affect them.
- It helps to ask yourself a few questions.
- What role does this audience play? What is their stake in the project? What do they hope to get from the data insights I deliver? Let's say you're analyzing readership data from customers to help a magazine publisher decide if they should switch from quarterly to monthly issues.
- If your stakeholder audience includes people from the printing company, they're going to care because the change means they have to order paper and ink more frequently.
- They also might need to assign more staff members to the project.
- Or if your stakeholders include the magazine authors and editors, you'll want to keep in mind that your recommendations might change the way they work.
- For instance, they might need to write and edit stories at a faster pace than they're used to.
- Once you've considered the answers to those questions, it's time to choose your primary message.
- Every single part of your story flows from this one key point, so it's got to be clear and direct.
- With that in mind, let's think about the key message for the data project about our pretend magazine.
- Maybe the readership data from customers shows that print magazine subscriptions have been going down recently.
- You discover in survey data that this is mainly because readers feel the information is outdated, so this finding suggests that readers would probably appreciate a publication cycle that gets the information into their hands more often.
- But that's not all.
- Your reader survey data also shows that readers prefer shorter articles with quick takeaways.
- The data is generating a lot of possible decision points.
- The volume and variety of information in front of you may feel challenging.
- To get the key message, you'll need to take a few steps back and pinpoint only the most useful pieces.
- Not every piece of data is relevant to the questions you're trying to answer.
- A big part of being a data analyst is knowing how to eliminate the less important details.
- One way to do this is with something called spotlighting.
- Spotlighting is scanning through the data to quickly identify the most important insights.
- There are many ways to spotlight, but lots of data analysts like to use sticky notes on a whiteboard, like how archaeologists make sense of the artifacts they discover in a dig.
- To do this, you write each insight from your analysis on a piece of paper, spread them out, and display them on a whiteboard.
- Then you examine it.
- It's important not to get bogged down in every tiny detail.
- Instead, look for broad universal ideas and messages.
- Try to find ideas or concepts that keep popping up again and again or numbers and words that are repeated often.
- Maybe you're finding things that look like they're connecting or forming patterns.
- Highlight these items or group them together on your whiteboard.
- Next, explore your discoveries.
- Find the meaning behind the numbers.
- The idea is to identify which insights are most likely to help solve your business problem or give you the answers you've been seeking.
- This is how spotlighting can lead you to your key message.
- Remember to keep your key message clear and concise, as an overly-long message like this one shown on screen has less chance of conveying the most important conclusion.
- Here's a clear, concise message that's likely to engage your audience because it's short and to the point.
- Of course, no matter how much time and effort you put into studying your audience, you can't predict exactly how they'll react to your recommendations.
- But if you follow the steps we're discussing, you'll be much more likely to have good results.
- In an upcoming video, you'll learn how to deal with situations that don't go quite according to plan.
- That's okay.
- It happens to all of us.
