# Evaluation practice

You just spent some time with Connor looking at "messy" and "good" data presentations. He highlighted problems in the messy presentation and demonstrated how a good presentation tells a clearer story and provides a more logical flow for the audience.

Take a moment to reflect on everything that Connor shared and, if helpful, review the notes you took while watching the videos.

How has your thinking changed about creating a good presentation after you have analyzed data?

## My Response

Connor's insights on data presentations have reshaped my approach. I now prioritize simplicity, clarity, and a logical flow, focusing on establishing a clear narrative from introduction to conclusion. The emphasis on audience engagement through visuals, animations, and annotations has shifted my perception of their role in aiding comprehension. Recognizing the importance of transition slides and maintaining a consistent theme throughout the presentation has become a priority. I now view presentations as stories, making data more relatable and memorable. Connor's advice on speaker notes has prompted me to balance in-depth explanations with concise on-screen text. Lastly, I appreciate the encouragement to infuse personal style and skills into presentations, seeing them as opportunities for creative expression within effective communication bounds.
