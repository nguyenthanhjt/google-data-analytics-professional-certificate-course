# Video: Present with a framework

Video transcript

- Hi again.
- Earlier in this program, you learned how to keep your audience in mind when communicating your data findings.
- By making sure that you're thinking about who your audience is and what they need to know, you'll be able to tell your story more effectively.
- In this video, we'll learn how to use a strategic framework to help your audience understand the most important takeaways from your presentation.
- To make your data findings accessible to your audience, you'll need a framework to guide your presentation.
- This helps to create logical connections that tie back to the business tasks and metrics.
- As a quick reminder, the business task is the question or problem.
- your data analysis answers.
- The framework you choose gives your audience context to better understand your data.
- On top of that, it helps keep you focused on the most important information during your presentation.
- The framework for your presentation starts with your understanding of the business task.
- Raw data doesn't mean much to most people, but if you present your data in the context of the business task, your audience will have a much easier time connecting with it.
- This makes your presentation more informative and helps you empower your audience with knowledge.
- That's why understanding the business task early on is key.
- Here's an example.
- Let's say we're working with a grocery store chain.
- They've asked us to identify trends and online searches for avocados to help them make seasonal stocking decisions.
- During our presentation, we want to make sure that we continue focusing on this task and framing our information with it.
- Let's check out this example slide presentation.
- We can begin our presentation by framing it with the business task here.
- In this second slide, I've added goals for the discussion.
- It starts with "share an overview of historical online avocado searches."
- Under that, a more detailed explanation: "We'll cover how avocado searches have grown year over year and what that means for your business." Then we'll "examine seasonal trends in online avocado searches using historical data." This is important because "understanding seasonal trends can help forecast stocking needs and inform planning." And finally, "discuss any potential areas for further exploration."
- This is where we'll address next steps in the presentation.
- This clearly outlines the presentation so our audience knows what to expect.
- It also lets them know how the information we share is going to be connected to the business task.
- You might remember, we talked about telling a story with data before.
- You can think of this like outlining the narrative.
- We can do the same thing with our data viz examples.
- If we're showing this visual graph of annual searches for avocados, we might want to frame it by saying this graph shows the months with the most online searches for avocados last year, so we can expect that this interest in avocados will fall on the same months this year.
- That can even be used in our speaker notes for the slide.
- This is a great place to add important points you want to remember during the presentation ahead of time.
- These notes aren't visible to your audience in presentation mode, so they're great reminders you can refer to as you present.
- Plus, you could even share your presentation with speaker notes ahead of time to make the content more accessible for your audience.
- Using this data, the grocery store can anticipate demand and make a plan to stock enough avocados to match their customers' interests.
- That's just one way we can use the business task to frame our data and make it easier to understand.
- You also want to make sure you're outlining and connecting with your business metrics by showcasing what business metrics you use.
- You can help your audience understand the impact your findings will have.
- Think about the metrics we use for our avocado presentation.
- We track the number of online searches for avocados from different months over several years to anticipate trends and demand.
- By explaining this in our presentation, it's easy for our audience to understand how we used our data.
- These data points alone—the dates or number of searches— aren't useful for our audience, but when we explain how they're combined as metrics, the data we're sharing makes so much more sense.
- Here's another potential data viz that we want to use.
- We can frame it for our audience by including some of our metrics.
- There's an explanation of what time period this data covers: "Our data shows Google search queries from 2004 to 2018." Where we gathered this data from: "Search queries are limited to the United States only." And a quick explanation of how the trends are being measured:
- "Google trends scores are normalized at 100." So now that our audience understands the metrics we use to organize this data, they'll be able to understand the graph more clearly.
- Using a strategic framework to guide your presentation can help your audience understand your findings, which is what the sharing phase of the data analysis process is all about.
- Coming up, we'll learn even more about how to weave data into your presentations

## Question & Notes

- The framework of your presentation starts with your understanding of the business task.
- By showcasing what business metrics you used, you can help our audience understand the impact your findings will have.

### Question 1:When creating a presentation to share with stakeholders, what are the purposes of a framework? Select all that apply.

- Describe the question or problem your data analysis answers
