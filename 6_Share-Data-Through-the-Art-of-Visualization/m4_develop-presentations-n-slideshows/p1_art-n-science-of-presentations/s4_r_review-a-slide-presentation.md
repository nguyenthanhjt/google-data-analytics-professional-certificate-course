# Review a Slide Presentation

You have started learning how to create effective slide presentations to share your findings. In this reading, you’ll develop a rubric to help you evaluate slide presentations. By the end of this reading, you will have a stronger understanding of how to create an effective slide presentation using best practices from this course. This will help you evaluate your own work.

## Your Evaluation Criteria

When exploring a slide presentation, use your knowledge of effective presentation practices to evaluate it. This includes reviewing your own work! When you’re checking over slide presentations, there are some best practices you can check for:

1. **Include a Title, Subtitle, and Date:** Making sure that your slide deck presentation has a title, subtitle, and date ensures that your audience knows exactly what you are presenting and when the information was from. That way they know it’s relevant and current to them!

2. **Use a Logical Sequence of Slides:** Organizing your slides in an order that makes sense guides your audience through your narrative, building understanding step by step.

3. **Provide an Agenda with a Timeline:** An agenda offers a roadmap of your presentation, allowing your audience to follow along and anticipate key topics.

4. **Limit the Amount of Text on Slides:** Keeping text brief ensures clarity and retains the audience’s attention; aim for your audience to scan it within 5 seconds.

5. **Start with the Business Task:** By immediately relating the content to the business task at hand, you contextualize your information, making it relevant and actionable.

6. **Establish the Initial Hypothesis:** Presenting an initial hypothesis gives your audience a starting point for what to expect and frames the subsequent analysis.

7. **Show What Business Metrics You Used:** Clarifying which metrics you're analyzing validates your arguments and helps the audience gauge your presentation's relevance to business outcomes.

8. **Use Visualizations:** Visual aids can illustrate complex data more effectively than text alone, making your message more accessible.

9. **Introduce the Graphic by Name:** A brief introduction to each graphic aids in understanding and retaining information.

10. **Provide a Title for Each Graph:** Titles act as signposts, helping the audience quickly grasp the meaning of each visual.

11. **Go from the General to the Specific:** Starting with a broad overview before diving into details ensures that all audience members are on the same page.

12. **Use Speaker Notes to Help You Remember Talking Points:** Notes act as your cue cards, enabling a smoother delivery and ensuring no critical point is missed.

13. **Include Key Takeaways:** Summarizing the main points at the end of your presentation reinforces the message and ensures the audience leaves with the intended takeaways.

Like so many parts of your job as a data professional, creating presentations is an iterative process. Reviewing your work, making changes as needed, and improving it when you can will make your presentations clearer and more useful for stakeholders.

## Create an Evaluation Table

Now that you have an understanding of what best practices you are trying to apply to slide presentations, organize your reviews using an evaluation table. An evaluation table essentially gives you a checklist for each slide in a presentation so you can identify any changes that need to be made in an organized fashion. The evaluation table should have a column for the slide number, a column for you to take notes on what worked well, and a column for what could be improved. Here’s an example of a blank evaluation table:

| Slide # | What Works Well | What Could Be Improved |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1       |                 |                        |
| 2       |                 |                        |
| 3       |                 |                        |
| 4       |                 |                        |
| 5       |                 |                        |
| 6       |                 |                        |
| 7       |                 |                        |

You can use evaluation tables to note things you liked about a presentation as well as things you would like to improve!
