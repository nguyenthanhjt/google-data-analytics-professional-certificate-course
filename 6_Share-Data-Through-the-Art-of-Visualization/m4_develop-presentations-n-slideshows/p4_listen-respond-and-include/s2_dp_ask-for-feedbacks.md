# Discussion Prompt: Ask for Feedback

During a presentation, you should pay special attention to the needs of your audience. In a data analysis setting, your audience will likely include your stakeholders or supervisors. They have a vested interest in the work you’ve done, so it is important to communicate your findings to them as clearly as possible.

At the end of a presentation, you’ll typically be asked to hold a question and answer (Q&A) session. During the Q&A, your audience can ask you for clarification about what you’ve presented or provide advice about how to proceed.

In some cases, you might find that stakeholders don’t know how best to ask a question. Imagine a scenario in which a stakeholder is confused about what you’ve discussed, but is having trouble figuring out how to ask their question in a group setting. With this scenario in mind, consider the following questions:

1. **Diverse Feedback Channels:** Implement various feedback channels, such as surveys, emails, or one-on-one discussions, to cater to different preferences.

2. **Inclusivity:** Encourage an inclusive environment by welcoming questions through multiple mediums, like anonymous question submission or private follow-up discussions.

3. **Creative Engagement:** Employ creative methods, like interactive surveys, live polls, or post-presentation workshops, to engage the audience actively.

By diversifying feedback avenues and promoting inclusivity, you can create an environment where stakeholders feel comfortable providing input, fostering a more collaborative and insightful data analysis process.
