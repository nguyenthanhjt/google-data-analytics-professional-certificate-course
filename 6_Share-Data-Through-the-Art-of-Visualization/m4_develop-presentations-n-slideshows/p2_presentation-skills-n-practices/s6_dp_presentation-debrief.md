# Discussion Prompt: Presentation debrief

Presentations are a crucial part of communicating about your data effectively. By practicing presentation skills in advance, you can become comfortable with public speaking and master an integral part of the data analyst role.

One way to practice presenting is to learn from your past experiences. Think about a presentation you gave in the past. This might be a formal presentation in a professional setting or an experience from your personal life, such as a toast at a wedding. Reflect on how that presentation went and consider the following questions:

- What went well during your presentation? Based on what youâ€™ve learned about giving presentations, which tips do you already practice?
- In what areas do you want to improve your presentation skills?
- What presentation skills do you want to learn more about? In what areas do you want to improve?

Submit 3-5 sentences (150-200 words) responding to these questions. Then, visit the discussion forum to read what others have written, and respond to at least two posts with your own thoughts.

## My response

In a recent professional presentation, I believe I succeeded in maintaining a structured flow, adhering to the McCandless method by starting with broad ideas and gradually delving into specifics. I also incorporated visual aids effectively, ensuring they complemented the narrative. However, I identified a need for improvement in my delivery style. While I practiced intentional pauses, I realized the importance of maintaining a consistent level pitch in my sentences. I want to enhance my ability to keep the audience engaged by refining my speaking style further. Additionally, I aim to learn more about incorporating compelling storytelling elements into data presentations to make them more impactful and memorable. Storytelling seems to be a powerful tool in conveying complex information, and I believe it can significantly contribute to audience understanding and retention of key insights.

In a recent presentation, I found that my use of visuals and storytelling helped engage the audience effectively. I practiced incorporating the McCandless method by starting with broad ideas and gradually delving into specifics, which seemed to keep the audience's attention. However, I realized that I need to work on managing my nervous energy better, particularly in controlling my speaking pace and minimizing filler words. I aim to improve my ability to maintain consistent eye contact with the audience and to refine my use of body language to enhance my delivery. Additionally, I'm interested in learning more about effective slide design and how to create visually appealing presentations that support rather than distract from the message.
