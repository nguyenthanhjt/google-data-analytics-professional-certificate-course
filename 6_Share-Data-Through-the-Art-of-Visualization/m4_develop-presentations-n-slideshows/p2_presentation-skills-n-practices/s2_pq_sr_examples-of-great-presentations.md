## Step by step instructions

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then answer the question at the end of the activity before going to the next course item.

### Step 1: Review the McCandless method

As you look at examples in the next section of this activity, ask yourself: How do these presentations use the McCandless method?

As a refresher, the McCandless method is a set of guidelines for presentations. It suggests that you start with broad, general ideas and then work your way into the details.

The steps of the McCandless method include:

1. Introduce the graphic by name

2. Answer obvious questions before they’re asked

3. State the insight of your graphic

4. Call out data to support that insight

5. Tell your audience why it matters

### Step 2: View examples of great spoken presentations

TED Talks are short, spoken messages with important ideas. Take some time to watch the three TED talks linked below, which were carefully selected as model examples of great presentations. As you watch the videos, ask yourself how they each show characteristics of an effective presentation:
