### Step 1: Review the McCandless method

As you look at examples in the next section of this activity, ask yourself: How do these presentations use the McCandless method?

The steps of the McCandless method include:

1. Introduce the graphic by name

2. Answer obvious questions before they’re asked

3. State the insight of your graphic

4. Call out data to support that insight

5. Tell your audience why it matters
