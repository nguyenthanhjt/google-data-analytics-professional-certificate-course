# Evaluate Your Presentation

Earlier in this course, you practiced creating, giving, and evaluating your own presentation for the [**Hands-on Activity: Presenting practice**](../../m3_craft-data-stories/p3_share-data-stories/s3_pq_activity_practice-presenting.md). You also learned some best practices for slide presentations and how you can evaluate presentations using them. In this reading, you will take a moment to reflect on how much your presentation skills have developed and create a presentation checklist for yourself to use in the future. This will help you prepare for future presentations as a data analyst and give you a tool to review your own work.

## Presentation Evaluation Checklist

The ability to deliver compelling presentations is just as important as your analyses. Consider your presentation skills and how integral they are to your professional growth. Each time you present, you're not just sharing data; you're telling its story. This requires clear, jargon-free language, especially when addressing an audience not specialized in data analysis. A well-crafted presentation bridges the gap between complex data and actionable insights.

You can enhance your presentation skills by using a presentation checklist. Use it as a personal guide to ensure your message is delivered clearly and effectively. The checklist can be tailored to meet your style and objectives to ensure that it resonates with your audience.

### Create Your Own Checklist

As you review your presentation style, focus on the clarity and engagement of your content. Incorporate visuals that complement your narrative and use pauses to let your insights sink in. Every piece of feedback is valuable, offering you a chance to learn and improve. Treat your presentation like a dialogue, not a monologue, and tailor it to foster a connection with your audience.

While using your presentation checklist, pay attention to the effectiveness of your visual aids. They should not only represent data accurately but also highlight the key takeaways in a manner that reinforces your message. Through critical self-review, use this checklist to refine both your verbal and visual communication, turning data into compelling stories. Here are some questions you can incorporate into your checklist:

- Do I use an attention-grabbing opening?
- Do I start with broad ideas and later talk about specific details?
- Do I speak in short sentences?
- Do I pause for five seconds after showing a data visualization?
- Do I pause intentionally at certain points?
- Do I keep the pitch of my sentences level?
- Do I stand still and move with purpose?
- Do I have good posture?
- Do I look at my audience (or camera) while speaking?
- Do I keep my message concise?
- Do I end by explaining to my audience why the data analysis matters?

You can also add checklist items that help you refine your slide deck:

- Do I include a good title and subtitle that describes what Iâ€™m about to present?
- Do I include the date of my presentation or the date when my slideshow was last updated?
- Does my font size let the audience easily read my slides?
- Do I showcase what business metrics I used?
- Do I include effective visuals (like charts and graphs)?

## Key Takeaways

Embracing a cycle of practice, feedback, and refinement underpins professional development in data analysis. A well-crafted presentation checklist can be a key growth accelerator, helping you present complex data simply and captivating your audience. Make it a habit to use this checklist to evaluate your work and welcome constructive criticism. Approach every presentation as a chance to improve your ability to tell a compelling story and become a more skilled and persuasive communicator.
