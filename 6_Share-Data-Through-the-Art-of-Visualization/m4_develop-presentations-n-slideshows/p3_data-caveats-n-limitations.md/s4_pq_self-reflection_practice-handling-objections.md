# Practice Quiz: Self-Reflection: Practice handling objections

## Activity Overview

Now that you have learned about how to handle objections to your data, you can pause for a moment and think about what you are learning. In this self-reflection, you will consider your thoughts about how to respond to objections when giving a presentation and answer brief questions about your approach.

This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to apply your knowledge of handling objections to real-world scenarios. As you answer questions—and come up with questions of your own—you will consider concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You’ve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

## Step by step instructions

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then answer the question at the end of the activity before going to the next course item.

### Step 1: Respond to a business taks

While delivering a presentation to an audience, your primary goal is to respond to a business task. A business task is a question or problem you use data to solve—and a presentation demonstrates how to solve it. Business tasks can have a variety of contexts and scopes, so the details of your presentation will depend on a lot of factors.

Sometimes, you may receive questions or objections about your presentation. This is normal, as your audience wants to understand your presentation as completely as possible. Responding to these questions and objections in a clear, concise, and polite manner is crucial to delivering an effective presentation.

### Step 2: Review examples of objections

Consider the following situations where a data analyst delivers a presentation and receives an objection:

1. An analyst is presenting on the sales revenue of their company’s new product: an autonomous vacuum cleaning robot. The analyst shows the steps they took for each part of the analysis. They are confident that they have explained each step very thoroughly, but a stakeholder is confused when the presentation is over. They share a concern that the analysis may be incomplete.

2. An analyst is presenting on the effectiveness of a new drug treatment for heartburn. They use data from an external private company that describes how common heartburn is in the United States. After the presentation, they receive an objection from their stakeholder about the data collected. The stakeholder is concerned that the source of the data may not be reputable, and is unsure about the credentials of the data’s source company.

3. An analyst is presenting on the traffic patterns of a particular highway in their city. After extensive research and analysis, they conclude that Friday is the busiest day for commuters on that highway. One of the stakeholders, who commutes along that highway, disagrees and believes that Monday is the busiest day for traffic.

## Reflection

Consider an objection from one of the three previous scenarios:

- If you were the data analyst involved, how would you respond to your stakeholders?
- What would be the impact of not addressing these objections?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.

### My responses

If I were the data analyst in scenario 1, I would address the stakeholder's concern by revisiting the specific steps of the analysis and providing additional clarification where needed. Failing to address this objection might result in a lack of confidence in the completeness of the analysis, impacting the stakeholder's trust in the presented insights.

In scenario 2, I would respond by highlighting the credibility of the data source, sharing any relevant information about the source company's reputation, and addressing the stakeholder's concerns about data reliability. Neglecting to address these objections could lead to doubts regarding the quality and reliability of the data, potentially undermining the credibility of the entire presentation.

In scenario 3, I would engage in a constructive dialogue with the stakeholder who disagrees about the busiest day for traffic. I might reevaluate the analysis, consider additional perspectives, and present any supportive data. Failing to address this objection could result in a lack of alignment with stakeholders and a potential disconnect between the presented findings and the stakeholders' real-world experiences.

If I were the data analyst involved in Scenario 1, I would address the stakeholder's concern by revisiting the steps of the analysis and providing additional clarity where needed. Failure to address this objection could lead to misunderstanding or mistrust in the analysis results, undermining the credibility of the presentation.

In Scenario 2, I would respond by reassuring the stakeholder about the credibility of the data source, providing any relevant information or validation methods used to ensure data quality. Ignoring this objection could lead to skepticism about the validity of the findings, impacting decision-making based on the presentation.

For Scenario 3, I would discuss the methodology used to analyze the traffic patterns and present supporting evidence for the conclusion about Friday being the busiest day. Failing to address this objection might result in conflicting perceptions about traffic patterns, hindering consensus and potentially leading to ineffective strategies for managing traffic congestion.

> Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! Using the first scenario as an example: If you receive an objection about the completeness of your analysis, you should politely acknowledge the objection. Then, reiterate each step you took in your analysis and explain why you did each one. Finally, promise to investigate your analysis question further so that the analysis is complete or your presentation is more clear.

> If you don’t address the objection, your stakeholders may not appreciate or respect the work you’ve done in your analysis. By communicating respectfully with your stakeholders, you establish a positive relationship with them. You also can use their feedback to improve your analytical approach for future presentations.
