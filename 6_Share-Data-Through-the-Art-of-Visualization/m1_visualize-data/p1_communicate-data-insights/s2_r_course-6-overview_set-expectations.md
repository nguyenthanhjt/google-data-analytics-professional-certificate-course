### What to Expect

Each course offers many types of learning opportunities:

- Videos for instructors to teach new concepts and demonstrate the use of tools
- In-video questions that pop up from time to time to help you check your understanding of key concepts and skills
- Step-by-step guides you can use to follow along with instructors as they demonstrate tools
- Readings to explore topics more in-depth and build on the concepts from the videos
- Discussion forums to share, explore, and reinforce lesson topics
- Discussion prompts to promote thinking and engagement in the discussion forums
- Practice quizzes to prepare you for graded quizzes

This program was designed to let you work at your own pace—your personalized deadlines are just a guide. There is no penalty for late assignments. To earn your certificate, you simply need to complete all of the work.

If you miss two assessment deadlines in a row, or if you miss an assessment deadline by two weeks, you'll see a `Reset deadlines` option on the **Grades** page. Click it to switch to a new course schedule with updated deadlines. You can use this option as many times as you need—it won’t remove any progress you’ve already made in the course, but you may find new course content if the instructor updated the course after you started. If you cancel a subscription and then reactivate it, your deadlines will automatically reset.

In this course, you'll be assessed with quizzes that are based on the wide variety of learning materials and activities that reinforce the important skills you’ll develop. Both types of quizzes can be taken more than once.

### Tips for Success

- It is strongly recommended that you go through the items in each lesson in the order they appear because new information and concepts build on previous knowledge.
