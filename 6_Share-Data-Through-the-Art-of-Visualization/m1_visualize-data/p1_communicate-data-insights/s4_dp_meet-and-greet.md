# Ungraded Plugin: Meet and Greet

Now that you’ve learned more about the first five steps of the data analysis process, share your data findings with the art of storytelling and data visualization. Data visualization is the graphical representation of data. It can help you share meaningful insights about your data with stakeholders and tell your data story more effectively. Throughout this course, you’ll explore examples of effective data visualizations and learn how to create them yourself.

Considering your own reactions to data visualizations can help you identify what makes an effective visualization. Think about a powerful data visualization you’ve encountered. Then, reflect on the following questions:

- What type of visualization was it?
- What elements did it use to convey information?
- What information did it convey?
- Why do you feel strongly about this visualization?

Submit 3-5 sentences (60-100 words) to respond to these questions. Then, visit the discussion forum to read what others have written and respond to at least two posts with your own thoughts.

*Participation is optional.*

## My Response

I encountered a powerful data visualization in the form of an interactive heat map showcasing global COVID-19 cases over time. The map effectively utilized color intensity to represent the severity of cases, allowing for quick identification of hotspots. Time animation conveyed the progression, and additional hover-over details provided specific information for each region. This visualization was impactful as it succinctly communicated the complex dataset, fostering a deeper understanding of the pandemic's global impact.
