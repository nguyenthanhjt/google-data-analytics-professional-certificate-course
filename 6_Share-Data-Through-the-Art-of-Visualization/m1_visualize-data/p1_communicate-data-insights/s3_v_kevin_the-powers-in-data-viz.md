# Video: Kevin: The power's in the data viz

Video transcript

- Data Analytics is the collection and analysis and then use of data to tell stories, using charts and visualizations, so that businesses can make better decisions.
- So I've always loved numbers and have always enjoyed math and calculus and those sorts of things.
- So data came really easy to me.
- I was working at a consultancy before and using lots of numbers, and I enjoyed it for sure.
- But it wasn't until I worked at an advertising agency where I saw the creative expression of numbers and how data could drive that creativity.
- That it really all fell into place for me and I realized that doing analytics in a marketing and in an advertising setting was exactly what I wanted to do.
- And I found that I just really enjoyed when we put those two things together.
- I think the visuals that come out of data analysis and data analytics are really beautiful, but what is even more interesting for me are the stories behind them.
- If you look at a big block of text or a big block of numbers, those stories are in there, but they really have to be found.
- And so it takes certain skill to pull those things out.
- And I find that skill, that analysis really exciting and interesting.
- But it ultimately then ends in a beautiful visualization, which I find very gratifying.
- There are great data visualization thinkers, and you see these visuals all over the place.
- You can find inspiration from looking at news outlets today and seeing the visuals that they present and how they tell stories that way.
- Visualizations have become so important that you can find them everywhere, and you could take great inspiration from that.
- But I also take inspiration from unlikely sources like photography and art and others and seeing how composition is created, how color is used.
- I think that's really important.
- And I try hard to bring those sorts of elements and those sorts of influences into the visualizations I create.
- So I know this course is pretty intense.
- We're throwing a lot at you.
- Your brain is probably overloaded.
- You're probably fried.
- Just stick with it.
- It is all going to start to piece together and make sense.
- The biggest thing that I think you can think of is just how important these skills really are.
- This is the new way of doing business, involving data, using the analytics tools and techniques that we're talking about to make decisions.
- So there's a great big reward waiting for you at the end of this course.
- I'm Kevin.
- I'm director of analytics here at Google.
