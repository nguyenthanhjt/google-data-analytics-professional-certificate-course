Video transcript

- Hey there, it's great to see how far you've come in this Google Data Analytics certificate.
- First of, I want to say congrats on your achievement.
- Second, welcome to your next course.
- It's all about the art of data storytelling through visualization.
- As a data analyst, you can do all the necessary work of planning, collecting, cleaning, and analysis.
- But you also need to show stakeholders what your data means in a compelling way using visuals.
- We're here to show you how that's done.
- With my experience as Director of Analytics at Google, I hope I'll be a pretty good guide.
- My name's Kevin, and I'll be your instructor for this course.
- This part of your training is particularly meaningful to me because I love data storytelling.
- I can't think of anything in today's business world that's more vibrant, more exciting, and more rewarding.
- With the amount of data we have around us, data analytics plays a key role in pretty much every part of business.
- In my opinion, there isn't a skill that's more important to you as an analyst than being able to effectively communicate the stories you want to covered to stakeholders.
- Stakeholders usually lack the time, access to data, or expertise needed to find those stories by themselves.
- That's why we'll focus on visualizing data to help you better share Data Stories.
- Which means we're now at the share phase of the data analysis process.
- We'll start with the basic concepts of visualization and why visualizing your analysis is such an important part of Data Analytics.
- From there, we'll discuss how to plan for and start building effective visualizations that are inclusive, accessible, and consider the audience first.
- Afterwards, we'll explore one possible tool you can use for data visualization, Tableau.
- Tableau helps us create visualizations from our analysis so that we can share our findings more effectively.
- We'll show you how data visualizations, including visual dashboards, can help bring your data to life.
- We'll also explore how you can use visualizations in your presentations and slide shows to continue telling a story with data.
- We'll discuss the art and science behind effective presentations.
- Finally, you'll learn how to anticipate and answer questions from stakeholders and respond to their feedback.
- Throughout the course, I'll guide you through what I think is the most exciting part of the data analysis process.
- By the end, you'll have everything you need to plan, create, and present an effective and compelling data visualization.
- Now that we've gotten to know each other little, it's time to get down to business.
- Coming up, we'll talk a bit about the history of data visualization and why visualizations mattered so much today.
- We'll also discuss the methods for using imagery effectively and what you can do to make the most out of your visuals.
- See you there.
