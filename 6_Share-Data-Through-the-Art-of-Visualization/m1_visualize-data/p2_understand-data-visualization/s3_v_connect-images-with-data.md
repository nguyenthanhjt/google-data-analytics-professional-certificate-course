# Video: Connect images with data

Video transcript

- Hello again.
- Earlier we talked about why data visualizations are so important to both analysts and stakeholders.
- Now we'll discuss the connections you can make between data and images in your visualizations.
- Visual communication of data is important to those using the data to help make decisions.
- To better understand the connection between data and images, let's talk about some examples of data visualizations and how they can communicate data effectively.
- You maybe come across lots of these in your daily life.
- We'll explore them a little bit more here.
- A good place to start is a bar graph.
- Bar graphs use size contrast to compare two or more values.
- The horizontal line of a bar graph usually placed at the bottom, is called the x-axis, and bar graphs with vertical bars, the x-axis is used to represent categories, time periods, or other variables.
- The vertical line of a bar graph usually placed to the left is called the y-axis.
- The y-axis usually has a scale of values for the variables.
- In this example, the time of day is compared to someone's level of motivation throughout the whole workday.
- Bar graphs are a great way to clarify trends.
- Here, it's clear this person's motivation is low at the beginning of the day and gets higher and higher by the end of the workday.
- This type of visualization makes it very easy to identify patterns.
- Another example is a line graph.
- Line graphs are a type of visualization that can help your audience understand shifts or changes in your data.
- They're usually used to track changes through a period of time, but they can be paired with other factors too.
- In this line graph, we're using two lines to compare the popularity of cats and dogs over a period of time.
- With two different line colors, we can immediately tell that dogs are more popular than cats.
- We'll talk more about using colors and patterns to make visualizations more accessible to audiences later too.
- Even as a line moves up and down, there's a general trend upwards and the line for dogs always stays higher than the line for cats.
- Now let's check out another visualization you'll probably recognize.
- Say hello to the pie chart.
- Pie charts show how much each part of something makes up the whole.
- This pie chart shows us all the activities that make up someone's day.
- Half of it's spent working, which is shown by the amount of space that the blue section takes up.
- From a quick scan, you can easily tell which activities make up a good chunk of the day in this pie chart and which ones take up less time.
- Earlier, we learned how maps help organize data geographically.
- The great thing about maps is they can hold a lot of location-based information and they're easy for your audience to interpret.
- This example shows survey data about people's happiness in Europe.
- The borderlines are well-defined and the colors added make it even easier to tell the countries apart.
- Understanding the data represented here, which we'll come back to again later, can happen pretty quickly.
- So data visualization is an excellent tool for making the connection between an image and the information it represents, but it can sometimes be misleading.
- One way visualizations can be manipulated is with scaling and proportions.
- Think of a pie chart.
- Pie charts show proportions and percentages between categories.
- Each part of the circle or pi should reflect its percentage to the whole, which is equal to 100 percent.
- So if you want to visualize your sales analysis to show the percentage of your company sales that come from online transactions, you could use a pie chart.
- The size of each slice would be the percentage of total sales that it represents.
- So if your online sales accounted for 60 percent, the slice would be 60 percent of the whole pie.
- Now here's a misleading pie chart.
- It's supposed to show opinions about pizza toppings, but each slice or segment represents more than one option.
- They all add up to well over 100 percent.
- There is lots of ingredients listed below the image that are not even included in the visual data.
- All of the segments are the same size, even though they're supposed to be showing different values.
- If a visualization looks confusing then it probably is confusing.
- Let's explore another example where the size of the graphic components comes into play.
- This time with a bar chart.
- In a truncated bar chart like this one, the values on the y-axis don't start at zero.
- The data points start at 9,100 and at intervals of 100.
- This makes it seem like the data, let's say, it's for novel clicks per day on different website links, is fairly wide-ranging.
- In this view, website E seems to clearly receive way more clicks than website D, which receives more clicks than website C and so on.
- While the graph is clear and the elements are easy to understand, the way the data is presented is misleading.
- Let's try to fix this by changing the graph's y-axis, so that it starts at zero instead.
- Now, the difference between the website clicks per day don't look nearly as drastic.
- By making the y-axis start at zero, we're changing the visual proportions to be more accurate and more honest.
- Some platforms always start their y-axis at zero, but other programs like spreadsheets might not fix the y-axis.
- So it's important to keep this in mind when creating visualizations.
- By following the conventions of data analysis, you'll be able to avoid misleading visualizations.
- You always want your visualization to be clear and easy to understand, but never at the expense of communicating ideas that are true to the data.
- So we've talked about some effective data-driven visualizations like bar graphs, line graphs, and pie charts, and when to use them.
- On top of that, we've discussed some things to avoid in your visualizations to keep them from being misleading.
- Coming up, we'll check out how to make those visualizations reach your target audience.
- See you then.

## Questions & Notes

- Bar graphs: use size contrast to compare two or more values
- Line graphs: help audience understand shifts or changes in your data
- Pie charts: show how much each part of something makes up the whole
- Maps: help organize data geographically

### Question 1: A bar graph has an x-axis and a y-axis. Describe the difference between the two. Select all that apply

- The x-axis is a vertical line. The y-axis is a horizontal line
- `The x-axis is used to represent categories, time periods, or other variables. The y-axis usually has a scale of values for variables`
- The x-axis usually has a scale of values for variables. The y-axis is used to represent categories, time periods, or other variables
- `The x-axis is a horizontal line. The y-axis is a vertical line`

> The x-axis is a horizontal line used to represent categories, time periods, or other variables. The y-axis is a vertical line that usually has a scale of values for variables.

## Keypoints

1. **Bar Graphs:**
   - Use size contrast to compare values.
   - X-axis represents categories or time periods; Y-axis has a scale of values.
   - Effective for clarifying trends and patterns.

2. **Line Graphs:**
   - Track changes over time or in conjunction with other factors.
   - Two lines of different colors can compare data effectively.
   - Demonstrates shifts or changes in data.

3. **Pie Charts:**
   - Show proportions of a whole.
   - Easily convey how much each part contributes.
   - Helpful for quick understanding of significant portions.

4. **Maps:**
   - Efficient for organizing geographical data.
   - Easy interpretation for the audience.
   - Example: Survey data on happiness in Europe.

5. **Potential Misleading Visualizations:**
   - Scaling and proportions can be manipulated.
   - Example: Misleading pie chart showing opinions about pizza toppings.
   - Truncated bar charts can misrepresent data if the y-axis doesn't start at zero.

6. **Avoiding Misleading Visualizations:**
   - Ensure the y-axis starts at zero for accurate representation.
   - Follow conventions of data analysis to avoid confusion.
   - Prioritize clarity without compromising accuracy.
