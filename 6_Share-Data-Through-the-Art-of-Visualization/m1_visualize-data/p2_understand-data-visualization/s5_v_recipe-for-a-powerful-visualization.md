# Video: A recipe for a powerful visualization

Video transcript

- Hey, there.
- You're back and ready to learn how to create powerful data visualizations.
- Coming up, we'll explore how to take our findings and turn them into compelling visuals.
- Earlier, we discussed the relationship between data and images.
- Now we'll build on that to explore what visualizations can reveal to your audience and how to make your graphics as effective as possible.
- One of your biggest considerations when creating a data visualization is where you'd like your audience to focus.
- Showing too much can be distracting and leave your audience confused.
- In some cases, restricting data can be a good thing.
- On the other hand, showing too little can make your visualization unclear and less meaningful.
- As a general rule, as long as it's not misleading, you should visually represent only the data that your audience needs in order to understand your findings.
- Now let's talk about what you can show with visualizations.
- Change over time is a big one.
- If your analysis involves how the data has changed over a certain period, which could be days, weeks, months, or years.
- You can set your visualization to show only the time period relevant to your objective.
- This visualization shows the search interests in news story topics like environment and science and social issues.
- The viz is set up to show how the search entries change day to day.
- The bubbles represent the most popular topic on each day in a given part of the US.
- As new stories come up, the data changes to reflect the topic of those stories.
- If we wanted the data for weekly or monthly news cycles, we change the interactive feature to show changes by week or month.
- Another situation is when you need to show how your data is distributed.
- A histogram resembles a bar graph, but it's a chart that shows how often data values fall into certain ranges.
- This histogram shows a lot of data and how it's distributed on a narrow range from a negative one to a positive one.
- Each bin or bucket, as the bar is called, contains a certain number of values that fall into one small part of the range.
- If you don't need to show that much data, other histograms would be more effective, like this one about the length of dinosaurs.
- Here the bins or buckets of data values are segmented.
- You can show each value that falls into each part of the range.
- If your data needs to be ranked, like when ordering the number of responses to survey questions.
- You should first think about what you want to highlight in your visualization.
- Bar charts with horizontal bars effectively show data that are ranked, with bars arranged in ascending or descending order.
- A bar chart should always be ranked by value, unless there's a natural order to the data like age or time, for example.
- This simple bar chart shows metals like gold and platinum ranked by density.
- An audience would be able to clearly see the ranking and quickly determine which metals had the highest density, even if this database included a lot more metals.
- Correlation charts can show relationships among data, but they should be used with caution because they might lead viewers to think that the data shows causation.
- Causation or a cause-effect relationship occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome.
- Correlation and causation are often mixed up because humans like to find patterns even when they don't exist.
- If two variables look like they're associated in some way, we might assume that one is dependent on the other.
- That implies causation, even if the variables are completely independent.
- If we put that data into a visualization, then it would be misleading.
- But correlation charts that do show causation can be effective.
- For example, this correlation chart has one line of data showing the average traffic for Google searches on Tuesdays in Brazil.
- The other lines for a specific date of search traffic, June 15th.
- The data is automatically correlated because both lines are representing the same basic information.
- But the chart also shows one big difference.
- When a football match or soccer match for Americans began on June 15th, the search traffic showed a significant drop.
- This implies causation.
- Football is a very popular and important sport for Brazilians, and the data in this chart verifies that.
- We've now talked about time series charts, histograms, ranked bar charts, and correlation charts.
- Each of these charts can visualize a different type of analysis.
- Your business objective and audience will help figure out which of these common visualizations to choose.
- Or you may want to check some other kinds of visualizations out there.
- There are also glossary visualizations that you'll be able to reference later.
- That wraps up our lesson on creating visualizations.
- Coming up next, we'll add some more layers to your planning and execution of visuals.
- Hang on tight.

## Questions and Notes

- One of your biggest considerations when creating a data visualization is where you'd like your audience to focus
- Correlation charts: show relationships among data
- Causation: occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome
- Time series charts
- Histograms
- Ranked bar charts

## Keypoints

1. **Considerations for Data Visualization:**
   - Focus on where you want your audience to concentrate; avoid showing too much or too little data.
   - Restrict data to what is necessary for understanding findings, as long as it is not misleading.

2. **Visualizations for Different Analyses:**
   - **Change Over Time:**
     - Utilize visualizations to demonstrate changes over a specific period (e.g., days, weeks, months, or years).
     - Example: Search interests in news story topics showing daily changes in the most popular topic in different parts of the US.

   - **Data Distribution:**
     - Histograms display how often data values fall into specific ranges.
     - Choose histogram variations based on the level of detail required for data representation.

   - **Ranked Data:**
     - Bar charts with horizontal bars effectively show ranked data.
     - Use when highlighting specific aspects of your data is essential.

   - **Correlation Charts:**
     - Exercise caution when using correlation charts to avoid implying causation.
     - Example: Correlation chart showing the correlation between Google searches and a football match in Brazil, indicating a drop in search traffic during the match.

3. **Choosing Visualizations:**
   - Select visualizations based on your business objectives and the needs of your audience.
   - Consider other visualization types available for different types of analysis.
