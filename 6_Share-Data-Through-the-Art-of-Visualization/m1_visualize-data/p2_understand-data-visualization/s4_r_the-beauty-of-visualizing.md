## *Inspiration is in the air*

**Data visualization** is the graphical representation of data. But why should data analysts care about data visualization? Well, your audience won’t always have the ability to interpret or understand the complex information that you relay to them, so your job is to inform them of your analysis in a way that is meaningful, engaging, and easy to understand. Part of why data visualization is so effective is because people’s eyes are drawn to colors, shapes, and patterns, which makes those visual elements perfect for telling a story that goes beyond just the numbers.

Of course, one of the best ways to understand the importance of data visualization is to go through different examples of it. As a junior data analyst, you want to have several visualization options for your creative process whenever you need.

### Engage Your Audience

Remember: an important component of being a data analyst is the ability to communicate your findings in a way that will appeal to your audience. Data visualization has the ability to make complex (and even monotonous) information easily understood, and knowing how to utilize data visualization is a valuable skill to have. Your goal is always to help the audience have a conversation with the data so your visuals draw them into the conversation. This is especially true when you have to help your audience engage with a large amount of data, such as the flow of goods from one country to other parts of the world.
