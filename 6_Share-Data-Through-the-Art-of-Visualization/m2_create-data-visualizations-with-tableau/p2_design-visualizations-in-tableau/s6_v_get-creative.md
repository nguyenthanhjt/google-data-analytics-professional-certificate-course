# Video: Get creative

Video transcript

- Hey, good to see you again.
- One of my favorite aspects of data visualizations is how creative it lets me be.
- You might remember me saying earlier that data viz the intersection of art and analytics, and it really is.
- I'm here to help you find your inner kid with a crayon from turning messy charts into effective ones to making your visuals more accessible to people who have color vision deficiencies.
- It's time to explore how your creativity can help you get the most out of your data.
- Jump right in by signing into your Tableau account, we'll return to our world Happiness Data in the Google Career Certificates Page.
- Click the link included in this video to Open the gallery, now click to view the workbook titled Just the Data: World Happiness.
- We use the same workbook in the earlier video about getting started with Tableau.
- Let's click up here to get started.
- Let's say we want to use this data in this table to figure out what the biggest contributors to a country's happiness score are.
- We'll start by digging into the relationship between happiness scores and the other country measures to see what we can find.
- To start, create a new worksheet to build your own data viz from scratch, you'll click on worksheet and then new worksheet.
- Since our data has three years of values, let's filter to 2016.
- To do this, add year to the filter shelf and choose 2016.
- Add happiness score to the rows shelf.
- Then add economy GDP per capita to the column shelf.
- Next drag and drop country to the detail section, this creates a separate circle or data point for each country.
- You might notice that where the economy scores higher, the happiness scores also higher.
- To make this trend easier to see, let's add a trend line.
- Now duplicate this sheet so that all of your formatting stays the same.
- In the duplicate sheet replace economy GDP per capita with another measure such as family.
- Drag the family table into the column shelf to replace economy.
- We'll rename our original tab economy.
- And this new tab family, so that we can easily recognize what they show and find them when we need.
- Try doing this for more of the measures.
- Now let's show what multiple visualizations on a single dashboard look like, so you can more easily see the relationship between them.
- Drag your visualizations, which are now listed on the left tables column one at a time to populate the dashboard.
- They could be arranged in different ways, take note of which trend lines have the steepest incline.
- Those are the ones with the strongest relationship, the happiness score.
- Each chart should have easily understood purpose that's immediately clear to your audience, and that's just what this does.
- You can also add a companion table, which shows the same data in a different way in case people in your audience prefer tables.
- In my experience, some stakeholders prefer to see their data in spreadsheets.
- We've been spending a lot of time using one data source, but you'll likely end up juggling more than one data set at a time as an analyst.
- Coming up, you'll have the option to learn more about combining multiple data sources in Tableau bye for now.

If you are following along with the video, duplicate the Family sheet and create the charts and trend lines for the **Health** and **Generosity** measures. The instructor will use all four sheets (Economy, Family, Health, and Generosity) to create a dashboard later in the video.

1. Right-click the **Family** tab at the bottom of your screen and select **Duplicate**.
2. In the Columns section, drop the **Health (Life Expectancy)** data on top of Family to change the data displayed.
3. Right-click the tab for the duplicated sheet, select **Rename**, enter **Health**, and click **OK**.
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 above, but drop the **Generosity** data on top of Family in step 2, and rename the sheet **Generosity** in step 3.

## **Key Points:**

1. **Creativity in Data Visualization:**
   - Data visualization allows for a creative intersection of art and analytics.
   - Creativity can transform messy charts into effective and visually appealing visualizations.

2. **Exploration in Tableau:**
