# Practice Quiz: Test your knowledge on creating visualizations in Tableau

## Question 1: What color combination does a diverging color palette use to display characteristics of values?

- `Intensity for the magnitude and hue for the range`
- Value for the range and tint for the margin of error
- Shade for the accuracy and grayscale for the reliability
- Intensity for the range and hue for the magnitude

> A diverging color palette uses intensity for the magnitude and hue for the range to display characteristics of values.

## Question 2: A data analyst creates a Tableau visualization to compare international trade routes. Which color choices could be misleading?

- `Green and red`
- Beige and purple
