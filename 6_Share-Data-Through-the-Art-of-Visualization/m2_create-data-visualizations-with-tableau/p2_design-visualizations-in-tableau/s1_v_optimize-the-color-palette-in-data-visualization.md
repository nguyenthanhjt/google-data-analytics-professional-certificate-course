# Video: Optimize the color palette in data visualization

Video transcript

- Hi there.
- In this video we'll take a closer look at effective and ineffective data visualizations using Tableau.
- That's right.
- Even though this platform can help you create some really beautiful visuals, all of those features and functions can lead to something that's just not very useful too.
- You might remember the five second rule we spoke about earlier.
- A sign of a good data visualization is that once you show it to an audience, they should understand what you're trying to convey within five seconds.
- This means it's clear, effective, and most importantly, convincing.
- If you keep that rule of thumb in mind before you begin any Tableau Viz, you'll be on the right path to creating good visuals.
- Let's take a look at an example of a good use of a diverging color palette.
- A diverging color palette displays two ranges of values using color intensity to show the magnitude of the number and the actual color to show which range the numbers from.
- It's a good way to show the difference between numbers.
- Here, green is associated with higher numbers and red with lower numbers.
- You may come across tables like this as it relates to business metrics and KPIs.
- The colors you choose should fit within the scope of the audience's expectations.
- While this might not always be true globally, a lot of people associate green with positive and red with negative.
- This makes things nice and clear.
- Here's an ineffective data Viz example.
- There's a lot about this Viz isn't working well, but these colors are hard to read.
- This graph uses green and orange and the data points are really close together.
- These colors don't clearly show the difference between low and high data points.
- Data visualization allows us to share meaningful stories about data, but we can't do it if it's too hard for the audience to understand the data Viz were sharing.
- Using color pairings that don't fit your audience's expectations could add another layer of unnecessary complexity.
- Brace yourself because there's another way to make an ineffective data visualization even worse.
- If you add a few too many labels, you end up with a data visualization that's really hard to take in.
- Doing this makes the visualization too busy.
- It takes up too much space and it prevents the labels from being clearly shown.
- All of this is made worse by using different fonts across the labels.
- What we have here is good data turn bad because of the visuals.
- Having an interactive visualization can be useful for both your audience and for you as the analyst.
- But just like anything else, the more power you have, the more responsibility you have.
- Lose sight on the qualities of a good viz and you can lose control over the story you want the data to tell.
- Now that you learned how to use visual enhancements to your advantage.
- Next up, we'll check out ways you can get even more creative with them.
- Stay tuned.

## Question & Notes

- Divering color palette: displays two ranges of values using color intensity to show the magnitude of the number and the actual color to show range the number is from

### Question 1: Fill in the blank: A diverging palette displays two ranges of values using color _____ to indicate magnitude

- balance
- value
- intensity
- spacing

> A diverging palette displays two ranges of values using color intensity to indicate magnitude. Intensity is a colorâ€™s brightness or dullness.

Absolutely, I'll continue providing summaries, key points, and responses to the questions in each section you provide. Let's proceed with the content you shared for section 2 of "Design Visualization in Tableau." Here's the summary:

## **Key Points:**

1. Effective data visualizations should be clear, convincing, and understandable within five seconds.
2. The choice of color palettes plays a crucial role in conveying information.
3. Diverging color palettes are useful for displaying two ranges of values, emphasizing color intensity to show magnitude.
