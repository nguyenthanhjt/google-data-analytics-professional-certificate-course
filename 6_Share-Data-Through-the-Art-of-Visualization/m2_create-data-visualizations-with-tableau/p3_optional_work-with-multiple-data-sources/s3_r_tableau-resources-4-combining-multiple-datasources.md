# Reading: Tableau resources for combining multiple data sources

Now that you have some experience working with data in Tableau, you are ready to start doing more, including combining multiple data sources. This reading will provide you with some how-to guides for that, and other helpful resources you can use as you practice using Tableau on your own.

| Resource | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Set up data sources](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/datasource_prepare.htm) | This page links to other resources explaining how to set up your data sources and prepare them for analysis once you have connected them to your Tableau account. It specifically includes articles explaining how to join or blend data, and what a union is and how they work. This is a great starting point as you get ready to begin using and combining data sources. |
| [Join your data](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/joining_tables.htm) | Joining refers to the process of combining data sources based on common fields. This article gives a more detailed explanation of the different joins, how to use them in Tableau, and an example join with a step-by-step guide. |
| [Don’t be scared of relationships](https://help.tableau.com/v2020.2/pro/desktop/en-us/datasource_dont_be_scared.htm) | Relationships allow you to combine multiple data sources in Tableau. This is a more flexible alternative to joins and doesn’t force you to create one single table with your multiple data sources. This article will give you more insight into how relationships work. |
| [How relationships differ from joins](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/datasource_relationships_learnmorepage.htm) | This article goes into more detail about the differences between using relationships and joins, and guides you through the process of using relationships to combine data. |
| [Blend your data](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/multiple_connections.htm) | Data blending is another method you can use to combine multiple data sources. Instead of truly combining the data, blends allow you to query and aggregate data from multiple sources. This resource goes into more detail about blending and includes a tutorial. |
| [Combining multiple date fields](https://kb.tableau.com/articles/howto/combining-start-and-end-dates-into-a-single-axis) | This resource provides examples that explain how to combine date fields when using four different methods of data combination in Tableau. |

These are just a few resources you can use. You can also find more information online or in the [Tableau community forums](https://community.tableau.com/s/).
