# Verify and report results

VIDEO transcript

- Hi there, great to have you back.
- You've been learning a lot about the importance of clean data and explored some tools and strategies to help you throughout the cleaning process.
- In these videos, we'll be covering the next step in the process**: verifying and reporting on the integrity of your clean data.
- Verification is a process to confirm that a data cleaning effort was well- executed and the resulting data is accurate and reliable.
- It involves rechecking your clean dataset, doing some manual clean ups if needed, and taking a moment to sit back and really think about the original purpose of the project.
- That way, you can be confident that the data you collected is credible and appropriate for your purposes.
- Making sure your data is properly verified is so important because it allows you to double-check that the work you did to clean up your data was thorough and accurate.
- For example, you might have referenced an incorrect cellphone number or accidentally keyed in a typo.
- Verification lets you catch mistakes before you begin analysis.
- Without it, any insights you gain from analysis can't be trusted for decision-making.
- You might even risk misrepresenting populations or damaging the outcome of a product that you're actually trying to improve.
- I remember working on a project where I thought the data I had was sparkling clean because I'd use all the right tools and processes, but when I went through the steps to verify the data's integrity, I discovered a semicolon that I had forgotten to remove.
- Sounds like a really tiny error, I know, but if I hadn't caught the semicolon during verification and removed it, it would have led to some big changes in my results.
- That, of course, could have led to different business decisions.
- There's an example of why verification is so crucial.
- But that's not all.
- The other big part of the verification process is reporting on your efforts.
- Open communication is a lifeline for any data analytics project.
- Reports are a super effective way to show your team that you're being 100 percent transparent about your data cleaning.
- Reporting is also a great opportunity to show stakeholders that you're accountable, build trust with your team, and make sure you're all on the same page of important project details.
- Coming up, you'll learn different strategies for reporting, like creating data- cleaning reports, documenting your cleaning process, and using something called the changelog.
- A changelog is a file containing a chronologically ordered list of modifications made to a project.
- It's usually organized by version and includes the date followed by a list of added, improved, and removed features.
- Changelogs are very useful for keeping track of how a dataset evolved over the course of a project.
- They're also another great way to communicate and report on data to others.
- Along the way, you'll also see some examples of how verification and reporting can help you avoid repeating mistakes and save you and your team time.
- Ready to get started? Let's go!

## Key Points from Section 1: Verify and Report Results

- **Importance of Verification**: Verification is a crucial step in the data cleaning process to confirm that the cleaning effort was well-executed, ensuring the resulting data is accurate and reliable.
- **Manual Cleanup**: Verification involves rechecking the cleaned dataset, performing manual cleanups if necessary, and reflecting on the original project's purpose.
- **Credibility of Data**: Proper verification ensures the credibility of the collected data, helping catch mistakes such as incorrect entries or typos before analysis.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Without verification, insights gained from analysis may be unreliable, leading to potential misrepresentation of populations or flawed decision-making.
- **Example**: The speaker shares a personal experience where a small error (a forgotten semicolon) could have significantly impacted the results and subsequent business decisions if not caught during verification.
- **Reporting Importance**: Reporting on data cleaning efforts is essential for open communication in a data analytics project. It shows transparency, accountability, and helps build trust with stakeholders.
- **Strategies for Reporting**: Different reporting strategies are discussed, including creating data cleaning reports, documenting the cleaning process, and using a changelog to track modifications made to a project over time.
- **Changelog Definition**: A changelog is a file that chronologically lists modifications made to a project, organized by version. It includes dates and details about added, improved, and removed features. Changelogs are useful for tracking dataset evolution and communicating with others.
- **Avoiding Mistakes**: Verification and reporting help in avoiding repeated mistakes, saving time for both the individual and the team.
