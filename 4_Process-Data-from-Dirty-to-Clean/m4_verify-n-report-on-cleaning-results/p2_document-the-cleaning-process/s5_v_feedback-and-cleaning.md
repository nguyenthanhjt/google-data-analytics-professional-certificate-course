# Video: Feedback and cleaning

Video transcript

- Welcome back.
- By now it's safe to say that verifying, documenting and reporting are valuable steps in the data-cleaning process.
- You have proof to give stakeholders that your data is accurate and reliable.
- And the effort to attain it was well-executed and documented.
- The next step is getting feedback about the evidence and using it for good, which we'll cover in this video.
- Clean data is important to the task at hand.
- But the data-cleaning process itself can reveal insights that are helpful to a business.
- The feedback we get when we report on our cleaning can transform data collection processes, and ultimately business development.
- For example, one of the biggest challenges of working with data is dealing with errors.
- Some of the most common errors involve human mistakes like mistyping or misspelling, flawed processes like poor design of a survey form, and system issues where older systems integrate data incorrectly.
- Whatever the reason, data-cleaning can shine a light on the nature and severity of error-generating processes.
- With consistent documentation and reporting, we can uncover error patterns in data collection and entry procedures and use the feedback we get to make sure common errors aren't repeated.
- Maybe we need to reprogram the way the data is collected or change specific questions on the survey form.
- In more extreme cases, the feedback we get can even send us back to the drawing board to rethink expectations and possibly update quality control procedures.
- For example, sometimes it's useful to schedule a meeting with a data engineer or data owner to make sure the data is brought in properly and doesn't require constant cleaning.
- Once errors have been identified and addressed, stakeholders have data they can trust for decision-making.
- And by reducing errors and inefficiencies in data collection, the company just might discover big increases to its bottom line.
- Congratulations! You now have the foundation you need to successfully verify a report on your cleaning results.
- Stay tuned to keep building on your new skills.

## Key Points

- **Value of Verification, Documentation, and Reporting**: Verifying, documenting, and reporting are essential steps in the data-cleaning process. They provide stakeholders with proof of accurate and reliable data, showcasing a well-executed and documented effort.
- **Importance of Feedback**: Obtaining feedback about the evidence presented is the next crucial step. Feedback from reporting on the data-cleaning process can lead to insights that are beneficial for the business, transforming data collection processes and influencing business development.
- **Insights from Data-Cleaning Process**: The data-cleaning process can reveal insights into common errors, including human mistakes, flawed processes, and system issues. Consistent documentation and reporting help uncover error patterns, enabling adjustments to data collection procedures and preventing the recurrence of common errors:
  - Human eror in data entry: mistyping, misspelling,...
  - Flawed processes: like poor design o a survey form, system issue where older systems integrate data incorrectly
- **Addressing Errors**: Feedback can guide actions to address identified errors. This may involve reprogramming data collection methods, modifying survey questions, or even rethinking expectations and updating quality control procedures.
- **Collaboration with Data Engineers or Owners**: In some cases, it's useful to schedule meetings with data engineers or data owners to ensure proper data integration and minimize the need for constant cleaning.
- **Trustworthy Data for Decision-Making**: Identifying and addressing errors result in stakeholders having trustworthy data for decision-making, potentially leading to significant improvements in the company's bottom line.

## Reflection Questions

- How does feedback from the data-cleaning process contribute to business development?

Feedback from the data-cleaning process can transform data collection processes, leading to insights that positively impact business development. By addressing errors and inefficiencies, the company can make informed decisions and potentially increase its bottom line.

- Why is consistent documentation important in uncovering error patterns during data cleaning?

Consistent documentation is crucial because it helps uncover patterns of errors in data collection and entry procedures. This information is valuable in making adjustments to prevent the repetition of common errors and improve overall data quality.
