- Hi! Good to see you! My name is Sally, and I'm here to teach you all about processing data.
- I'm a measurement and analytical lead at Google.
- My job is to help advertising agencies and companies measure success and analyze their data, so I get to meet with lots of different people to show them how data analysis helps with their advertising.
- Speaking of analysis, you did great earlier learning how to gather and organize data for analysis.
- It's definitely an important step in the data analysis process, so well done! Now let's talk about how to make sure that your organized data is complete and accurate.
- Clean data is the key to making sure your data has integrity before you analyze it.
- We'll show you how to make sure your data is clean and tidy.
- Cleaning and processing data is one part of the overall data analysis process.
- As a quick reminder, that process is **Ask**, **Prepare**, `Process`, **Analyze**, **Share**, and **Act**.
- Which means it's time for us to explore the Process phase, and I'm here to guide you the whole way.
- I'm very familiar with where you are right now.
- I'd never heard of data analytics until I went through a program similar to this one.
- Once I started making progress, I realized how much I enjoyed data analytics and the doors it could open.
- And now I'm excited to help you open those same doors! One thing I realized as I worked for different companies, is that clean data is important in every industry.
- For example, I learned early in my career to be on the lookout for duplicate data, a common problem that analysts come across when cleaning.
- I used to work for a company that had different types of subscriptions.
- In our data set, each user would have a new row for each subscription type they bought, which meant users would show up more than once in my data.
- So if I had counted the number of users in a table without accounting for duplicates like this, I would have counted some users twice instead of once.
- As a result, my analysis would have been wrong, which would have led to problems in my reports and for the stakeholders relying on my analysis.
- Imagine if I told the CEO that we had twice as many customers as we actually did!? That's why clean data is so important.
- So the first step in processing data is learning about data integrity.
- You will find out what data integrity is and why it is important to maintain it throughout the data analysis process.
- Sometimes you might not even have the data that you need, so you'll have to create it yourself.
- This will help you learn how sample size and random sampling can save you time and effort.
- Testing data is another important step to take when processing data.
- We'll share some guidance on how to test data before your analysis officially begins.
- Just like you'd clean your clothes and your dishes in everyday life, analysts clean their data all the time, too.
- The importance of clean data will definitely be a focus here.
- You'll learn data cleaning techniques for all scenarios, along with some pitfalls to watch out for as you clean.
- You'll explore data cleaning in both spreadsheets and databases, building on what you've already learned about spreadsheets.
- We'll talk more about SQL and how you can use it to clean data and do other useful things, too.
- When analysts clean their data, they do a lot more than a spot check to make sure it was done correctly.
- You'll learn ways to verify and report your cleaning results.
- This includes documenting your cleaning process, which has lots of benefits that we'll explore.
- It's important to remember that processing data is just one of the tasks you'll complete as a data analyst.
- Actually, your skills with cleaning data might just end up being something you highlight on your resume when you start job hunting.
- Speaking of resumes, you'll be able to start thinking about how to build your own from the perspective of a data analyst.
- Once you're done here, you'll have a strong appreciation for clean data and how imp1ortant it is in the data analysis process.
- So let's get started!
