# Dataset first impressions

Recently, you’ve been learning about data types, data structures, and databases. As a data analyst, you’ll have the chance to explore lots of different datasets. But before you begin, there are some important questions to consider:

- What steps might you take when you open a dataset for the first time?
- What have you learned about in this course that you can apply as you explore the dataset?

Please write two or more paragraphs (100-150 words) describing what you might do with a new dataset. You can include any steps or processes you’ve already learned about in your description. Then, visit the [discussion forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-data/discussions) to read what other learners have written, and engage in  discussions about at least two of their posts.

## My response

- What steps might you take when you open a dataset for the first time?
  - For the first time access a dataset, several steps can be taken to gain inital insights and set the foundation for further exploration. I think:
    - First, examining the dataset's meta data is crucial. We need to take a quick look to the Metadata, Metadata provides essential information about the dataset, including details about columns, data types, and any potential issues. Understanding the structure and nature of the data is vital for making informed decisions during the analysis.
    - After reviewing metadata, a preliminary exploration of the dataset can involve performing summary statistics and visualizations. Descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, offer a quick snapshot of the data's central tendencies and variability. Visualizations, like histograms or scatter plots, can reveal patterns, outliers, or potential trends.

- What have you learned about in this course that you can apply as you explore the dataset?
  - Explore database, schema properties, table relationships to basically understand the related business model
  - For each type of dataset storage: spreadsheets or Database, we can apply sorting, filtering methods to sample some data
