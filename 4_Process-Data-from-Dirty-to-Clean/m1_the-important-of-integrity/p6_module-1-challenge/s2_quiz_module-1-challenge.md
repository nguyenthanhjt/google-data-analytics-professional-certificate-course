# Course 4 - Module 1 challenge

## Question 1LFill in the blank: If a test is statistically significant, the results are less likely to be due to _____ and more likely to be due to a real difference between the groups being compared

- causation
- `random chance`
- insufficient data
- bias

## Question 2: A retailer keeps data in point-of-sale systems at its 10 local stores and an inventory management system at its central warehouse. When purchases are made at a store, they are only recorded in the point-of-sale systems. As a result, the inventory records are inaccurate and stores often run out of inventory. What data integrity problem does this scenario describe?

- Manipulation
- Gathering
- Transfer
- `Replication`

## Question 3:In a survey about a new type of protein bar, 70% of respondents report they would buy the bar again. The margin of error for the survey is 4%. Based on that margin of error, what range reflects the population's true response?

- 70-74%
- 74-78%
- `66-74%`
- 66-70%

## Question 4:A car dealer conducts a survey to understand why customers choose their dealership. They are eager for positive feedback, so they email the survey to only those customers who purchased two or more vehicles from the dealership in the past five years. What is likely to result?

- Geographically limited sampling
- `Sampling bias`
- Random sampling
- Unbiased sampling

## Question 5: Fill in the blank: To determine whether a survey or experiment has meaningful _____, a data team uses hypothesis testing

- significance
- `results`
- action items
- process steps

## Question 6:A data professional in the logistics industry wants to calculate the margin of error for a study about transportation route efficiency. They know the population size and sample size. What must they also know in order to accurately calculate margin of error?

- `Confidence level`
- Correlation
- Testing methodology
- Distribution

## Question 7: A data professional copies a dataset from a USB drive to their computer. They accidentally unplug the USB before the process is complete, which causes the dataset on their computer to be incomplete. What data integrity problem does this scenario describe?

- `Transfer`
- Manipulation
- Replication
- Cleaning

## Question 8: Which of the following statements accurately describe sample size, population, and confidence level? Select all that apply.

- `For effective outcomes, a data professional aims for a high confidence level in their sample.`
- `The goal of random sampling is to ensure every possible type of the sample has an equal chance of being chosen.`
- A confidence level of 75% is considered ideal by most industries.
- `Using sample size makes it possible to get enough information from a small group within a population to draw conclusions about the whole population.`
