# Self-Reflection: Challenges with SQL

## Overview

Now that you have practiced writing SQL functions, you can pause for a moment and think about what you are learning. In this self-reflection, you will consider your thoughts about your experience with learning SQL and respond to brief questions.

This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to identify your successes and difficulties with learning SQL so you can understand how to develop your skills further. As you answer questions—and come up with questions of your own—you will consider concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You’ve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

## Your SQL experience (so far)

So far, you have been introduced to many different tools available in SQL. As a brief review, you learned how to complete tasks such as:

- Getting data from a table using `SELECT` statements.
- De-duplicating data using commands like `DISTINCT` and `COUNT + WHERE`.
- Manipulating string data with `TRIM()` and `SUBSTR`.
- Creating/dropping tables with `CREATE TABLE` and `DROP TABLE`.
- Changing data types with `CAST`.

Some of these tasks are more challenging than others, and learning all the various SQL functions takes work. But, when you practice different functions, you can master the skills needed to make SQL work the way you need it to. Take a moment to think about the parts of SQL that you’ve found most challenging.

## Reflection

Consider everything you’ve learned about and practiced in SQL so far:

- Are there any areas of data processing with SQL that you’ve found particularly challenging?
- Are there any data processing skills that you’d like to improve upon? If so, what are they?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.

### My Response

In my SQL learning journey, I found the manipulation of string data using functions like SUBSTR and TRIM() to be challenging initially. Understanding how to extract and modify specific portions of text required practice and a deeper understanding of string functions. Additionally, I would like to improve my skills in efficiently utilizing aggregate functions like COUNT in combination with WHERE clauses for more complex data processing tasks. Strengthening these areas will contribute to a more comprehensive proficiency in SQL data processing.

> Pausing to reflect on your learning experience helps you identify areas to improve with practice and further study. This will help you reach your goals more effectively. If used correctly, SQL makes tasks like removing duplicates or cleaning string data much easier, especially with datasets that are too large to work on effectively with spreadsheets. As you build your skills in SQL, you will be able to process more complex data and start analyzing it.
