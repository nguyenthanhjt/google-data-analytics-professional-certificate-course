# Evan: Having fun with SQL

- Hi, I'm Evan.
- I'm a learning portfolio manager here at Google.
- I don't think I'm a computer science or super engineering type, but I really, really like working with numbers, so actually, I went into accounting.
- And about after two years of accounting I said, "Wow, I really don't want to do all this by hand," so I took my first information systems class, where they taught me the language SQL or S-Q-L, and it completely opened up my mind.
- Between a working knowledge of spreadsheets where you change one cell and the whole spreadsheet changes because those amazing calculated fields and SQL where I can query billions of rows of data in a matter of second, I was completely sold on my love for data.
- I've dedicated my life and my career to just communicating that passion and getting folks excited about the things that they can do with their data.
- Why is SQL such an amazing first language to pick up? Well, there's so many things that you can do with it.
- I will first caveat and say, I am not a computer science major.
- I don't know deep down Java and Python, and I was a little bit apprehensive of learning a computer language.
- It's like a pseudo-programming language, but in reality, you can write your first SQL statement as you're going to find out here in just five minutes or less.
- SQL, honestly, it's one of those languages that's easy to learn and even more fun to master.
- I've been learning SQL for 15 years.
- I've been teaching it for 10.
- As you're going to see in some of these hands-on labs you'll be working through, it's very easy to return data from within a database or a data set.
- Just select whatever columns from whichever database that you're pulling from, and immediately you get the data back.
- Now, the really fun part is actually teasing apart and saying, I wonder if I change my query, add these more columns, filter this data set a different way, share with my colleagues.
- It's meant to be an interactive querying language, and "query" means "asking a question." If I can challenge you one thing, it's that the syntax for picking up SQL, much like the rules of a chess game, are very easy to pick up.
- But the hard part is actually not the syntax writing, much like with any programming language, but the actual what question do you want to ask of your data? What I would encourage you to do is be super curious about whatever data set that you're given.
- Spend a lot of time, even before you touch your keyboard, in thinking about what data set or what insights you can get from your data.
- And then start having fun.
- There's many different ways to write the same correct SQL statement, so try one out, share it with your friends and then start returning that data back for insights.
- Good luck.

## Keypoints

- Evan's Background: Evan initially pursued a career in accounting due to his interest in working with numbers. However, after realizing the limitations of manual work, he took an information systems class where he learned SQL. This experience opened up his mind to the power of querying large datasets.
- Love for Data: Evan expresses his passion for working with data, emphasizing the significant impact of a working knowledge of spreadsheets and SQL. The ability to change one cell in a spreadsheet or query billions of rows of data with SQL has fueled his dedication to data-related work.
- SQL as a First Language: Evan, not being a computer science major, highlights that SQL is an excellent first language to pick up. Despite not having a deep understanding of languages like Java and Python, he found SQL to be accessible and fun to learn.
- Ease of Learning and Fun to Master: Evan describes SQL as a pseudo-programming language that is easy to learn and even more enjoyable to master. Despite his 15 years of learning and 10 years of teaching SQL, he emphasizes that the language is easy to grasp, especially for returning data from databases.
- Interactive Querying: SQL is meant to be an interactive querying language, allowing users to ask questions of their data. Evan encourages learners to be curious about the datasets they work with, spend time thinking about potential insights, and have fun exploring different ways to write SQL statements.
- Syntax vs. Querying Challenge: While the syntax of SQL is easy to pick up, Evan notes that the real challenge lies in determining what question you want to ask of your data. The difficulty is not in the syntax writing, similar to other programming languages, but in formulating the right queries based on the data.
- Encouragement to Learners: Evan encourages learners to be curious, spend time understanding their datasets before touching the keyboard, and enjoy experimenting with different ways to write SQL statements. He emphasizes that there are many correct ways to write the same SQL statement, providing flexibility for exploration and learning.
