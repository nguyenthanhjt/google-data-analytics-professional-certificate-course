# Understand SQL capabilities

Video Transcript

- Hello, again.
- So before we go over all the ways data analysts use SQL to clean data, I want to formally introduce you to SQL.
- We've talked about SQL a lot already.
- You've seen some databases and some basic functions in SQL, and you've even seen how SQL can be used to process data.
- But now let's actually define SQL.
- SQL is a structured query language that analysts use to work with databases.
- Data analysts usually use SQL to deal with large datasets because it can handle huge amounts of data.
- And I mean trillions of rows.
- That's a lot of rows to wrap your head around.
- So let me give you an idea about how much data that really is.
- Imagine a data set that contains the names of all 8 billion people in the world.
- It would take the average person 101 years to read all 8 billion names.
- SQL can process this in seconds.
- Personally, I think that's pretty cool.
- Other tools like spreadsheets might take a really long time to process that much data, which is one of the main reasons data analysts choose to use SQL, when dealing with big datasets.
- Let me give you a short history on SQL.
- Development on SQL actually began in the early 70s.
- In 1970, Edgar F.Codd developed the theory about relational databases.
- You might remember learning about relational databases a while back.
- This is a database that contains a series of tables that can be connected to form relationships.
- At the time IBM was using a relational database management system called System R.
- Well, IBM computer scientists were trying to figure out a way to manipulate and retrieve data from IBM System R.
- Their first query language was hard to use.
- So they quickly moved on to the next version, SQL.
- In 1979, after extensive testing SQL, now just spelled S-Q-L, was released publicly.
- By 1986, SQL had become the standard language for relational database communication, and it still is.
- This is another reason why data analysts choose SQL.
- It's a well-known standard within the community.
- The first time I used SQL to pull data from a real database was for my first job as a data analyst.
- I didn't have any background knowledge about SQL before that.
- I only found out about it because it was a requirement for that job.
- The recruiter for that position gave me a week to learn it.
- So I went online and researched it and ended up teaching myself SQL.
- They actually gave me a written test as part of the job application process.
- I had to write SQL queries and functions on a whiteboard.
- But I've been using SQL ever since.
- And I really like it.
- And just like I learned SQL on my own, I wanted to remind you that you can figure things out yourself too.
- There's tons of great online resources for learning.
- So don't let one job requirement stand in your way without doing some research first.
- Now that we know a little more about why analysts choose to work with SQL when they're handling a lot of data and a little bit about the history of SQL, we'll move on and learn some practical applications for it.
- Coming up next, we'll check out some of the tools we learned in spreadsheets and figure out if any of those apply to working in SQL.
- Spoiler alert, they do.
- See you soon.

## Keypoints

- Introduction to SQL:
  - SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
  - Analysts use SQL to work with databases, especially for handling large datasets.
- SQL's Handling of Large Datasets:
  - SQL is effective for processing massive amounts of data, even in the trillions of rows.
  - It surpasses other tools like spreadsheets in processing extensive datasets quickly.
- Comparison with Spreadsheets:
  - Spreadsheets may take a long time to process significant data, making SQL a preferred choice for data analysts dealing with big datasets.
- History of SQL:
  - SQL's development started in the early 70s.
  - Edgar F.Codd introduced the theory of relational databases in 1970, leading to the development of SQL.
  - SQL became the standard language for relational database communication by 1986.
- SQL's Standardization and Adoption:
  - SQL's adoption as a standard language contributes to its popularity among data analysts.
  - It is widely recognized within the data analysis community.
- Personal Experience with Learning SQL:
  - The speaker shares a personal experience of learning SQL for their first data analyst job.
  - SQL was a job requirement, and the speaker had a week to learn it.
  - Despite having no prior knowledge, the speaker taught themselves SQL and has been using it ever since.
- Self-Learning and Resources:
  - Encouragement for self-learning: The speaker emphasizes that individuals can figure things out on their own.
  - There are abundant online resources available for learning SQL.
- Practical Applications of SQL:
  - The section concludes by hinting at practical applications of SQL, including tools learned in spreadsheets that also apply to working in SQL.
