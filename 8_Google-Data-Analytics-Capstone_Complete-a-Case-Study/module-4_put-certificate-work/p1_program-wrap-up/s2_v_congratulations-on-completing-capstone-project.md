# Video: Congratulations on completing your Capstone Project!

Great job! You finished the capstone project for the program. This is a huge achievement. Take a moment to celebrate. Not only did you persevere through this whole program, but you went the extra step and put your knowledge and skills to work to create something real and really cool. The case study and portfolio shows just how far you've come and that hard work pays off. Now, you've got a great example of your work that you can show to potential employers that tells them just how skilled you are. Let me just say again. Congratulations. This brings us to the end of the program. But it's just the beginning of your journey in data analytics. No matter what comes next, you'll have the skills you need to be an amazing data analyst. I can't wait to see what you do. Thank you again for joining me for the capstone project. Goodbye, and good luck as you take your next step as a data analyst.
