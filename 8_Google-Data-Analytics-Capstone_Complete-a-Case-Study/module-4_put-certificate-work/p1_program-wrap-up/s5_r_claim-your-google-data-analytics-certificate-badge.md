## About the Google badge

### How do I claim my badge for completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate?

Upon completion of the certificate, you will receive an email letting you know you have earned a badge. From the email, you can choose to claim the badge and opt in to share your information for the purposes of badge issuing. If you decide to claim the badge, Coursera will then send a request to Acclaim to issue your badge. If you don’t have an Acclaim account yet, you will be asked to create one before you can accept and view your badge.

Please allow at least one week from your date of completion for the system to update. Make sure to check your spam folder just in case it ends up there!

### I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate. What do I do if I have not received an email invite to claim my badge?

If you’ve waited a week since you completed the certificate and haven’t received an email, please submit a request through the [Acclaim Help Center](https://support.youracclaim.com/hc/en-us).
