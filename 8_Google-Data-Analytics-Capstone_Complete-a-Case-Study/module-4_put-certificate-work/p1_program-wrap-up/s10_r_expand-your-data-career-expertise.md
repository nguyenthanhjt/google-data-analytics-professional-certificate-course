# Expand your data career expertise

Congratulations again on completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate! By now, you have wrapped up your capstone project, claimed your Certificate badge, and may be exploring new professional opportunities. You might also want to find ways to continue expanding your knowledge. That’s great—a huge part of being a data professional is continuing to learn!

There are two advanced Google Career Certificates that are designed to build on the foundational knowledge you developed in this program: the [Google Business Intelligence Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/google-business-intelligence) and the [Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics). If you are interested in growing your career as a data professional, this reading has information about these two advanced Google Career Certificates.

## Business intelligence versus advanced data analytics

**Business intelligence (BI)** uses processes and tools to turn raw data into easy-to-understand, actionable information. For example, creating dynamic and impactful dashboards helps stakeholders gain critical insights into the performance of an organization. The [Google Business Intelligence Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/google-business-intelligence) builds on your data analytics skills and helps unlock more career opportunities. You will practice your skills with hands-on activities using BigQuery, SQL, and Tableau.

**Advanced data analytics** uses math and statistics, programming, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) to uncover insights within an organization’s data structure. These insights can be used to guide stakeholder decision-making and strategic planning. The [Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics) will diversify your knowledge of analytics beyond the numbers to develop storytelling, advanced predictive modeling, and visualization techniques. You will complete hands-on activities using Jupyter Notebook, Python, and Tableau.

While both of these fields are concerned with data, they have different interests and approaches to that data:
