# Generative AI in data analytics: Practical applications

You’ve been exploring ways that AI can be used in the field of data analytics, such as helping to create data visualizations. Next, you’ll consider how you might use generative AI to complete tasks that you might be responsible for as a data analyst.

In a previous reading, you learned that AI refers to computer programs that can complete cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence. One specific type of AI is generative AI, which is AI that can generate new content, like text, images, or other media. [Gemini](https://gemini.com/), [ChatGPT](https://www.openai.com/chatgpt) by OpenAI, and [Microsoft Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot) are examples of generative AI tools. You can interact with a generative AI tool by typing in a prompt, which is input that provides instructions to an AI tool about how to generate output. The tool then creates new content based on that prompt.

In your work as a data analyst, you can leverage generative AI tools to help you complete both practical and creative tasks. Consider these applications of generative AI tools that can help you work more efficiently and effectively:

## Create content

Use generative AI tools to generate text, images, and other media. For example, you might create reports, data visualizations, or dashboards featuring data summaries. Generative AI tools can adjust visualizations based on the specific data and insights you want to highlight, enabling you to communicate complex information to stakeholders in an effective and engaging manner.

## Analyze information quickly

Generative AI tools can analyze large amounts of content quickly. For example, you might use generative AI to assess the outcome of a recent marketing campaign, helping you analyze campaign data and understand customer sentiment.

## Answer questions in detailed and nuanced ways

Generative AI is effective at summarizing information, which makes it useful for research. For example, you could prompt a generative AI tool to provide information about accessibility best practices for data visualizations.

## Simplify day-to-day work

Generative AI is also useful for augmenting routine tasks. For example, during the data cleaning process, you could prompt a generative AI tool to help write code to quickly perform data cleaning tasks like filling in missing values, applying consistent formatting, and removing duplicate data.

## Brainstorm ideas

AI tools can assist you in brainstorming ideas and conducting research. For example, during the initial phase of the data analysis process, you can leverage AI tools to help you brainstorm potential research questions. This can help you refine and develop a well-defined problem statement for your data project.

The ways you might use generative AI in your work will likely go beyond these examples as the capabilities of AI tools expand and as you continue your own development as a data analyst.
