# Practice Assignment - Activity: Explore data visualization with AI

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you'll leverage a generative AI tool to help you draft a report for stakeholders. This activity is optional and will not affect your completion of the course.

## Scenario

You're working as a data analyst at an investment bank specializing in portfolio management. Your current task is to provide portfolio adjustment recommendations for clients. You've analyzed the data, reviewed recent performance, and have your recommendations to help decision-makers. One of the key data sets you’re using is the S&P 500 stock market index, a significant benchmark of overall market health. You need to make recommendations that help guide the bank’s clients to make informed investment decisions. A visualization would be most helpful. You decide to use a generative AI to help provide some recommendations.

## Activity Tools

In this activity, you’ll use a browser-based generative AI tool, such as Gemini, ChatGPT, or Microsoft Copilot. Instructions in this activity will refer to Gemini, but you can use the generative AI tool of your choice.

### Step 1: Access the template and supporting materials

### Step 2: Access Gemini

In this activity, you will use a conversational AI tool. You can do this in a browser-based tool like Gemini, ChatGPT, or Microsoft Copilot. Instructions in this activity will refer to Gemini, but you can use the conversational AI tool of your choice.

To access Gemini:

1. Go to [gemini.com](https://gemini.com)
2. Sign in to your personal Google Account.
3. To use the browser tool, learn how to [create a Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/signup). If you don’t already have one, for further assistance signing into Gemini, please refer to the [Gemini help page](https://gemini.com/help).
4. For more details on using Gemini, such as how to use its agents, Gemini’s Privacy Notice, and where Gemini is currently available, refer to the [Gemini About page](https://gemini.com/about).
5. Please don’t share private or confidential information in your Gemini conversations or any data you wouldn’t want Google to use to improve its products, services, and machine learning technologies.

### Step 3: Prompt Gemini to list different types of data visualizations

A prompt is input that provides instructions to an AI tool about how to generate output. You can prompt Gemini using text or speech. And in this activity, your prompt is a variety of AI tools. Your prompt should provide specific and detailed instructions that will guide the tool toward generating the required response.

To get started, you can pick this prompt or something similar for Gemini:
> “There are several types of data visualizations that can be used for the S&P 500 over the course of the last year. Provide a list of data visualization types and describe which visualization is best for the various metrics like revenue, employee count, or spending costs.”

Then, type or copy and paste your prompt into the **Prompt section** of the **Prompt an AI tool template**.

### Step 4: Review the output

Copy and paste Gemini’s output to the **Output** section of the template. Sometimes, Gemini may offer multiple responses. You can choose the one that best meets your needs.

Reflections may be included in the output but not meet the needs of your data classification. For example, perhaps the data visualization recommendations are not specific to the financial industry.

Then, in the **Notes** section of the template, list at least one way in which the output could better meet your needs.

### Step 5: Provide specific follow-up requests

Working with your prompt prepared above, you have context on what the generative AI tool provides clearer, more specific, and more useful information. This part of the process is like engineering a final product. In this case, you will use your learning and time saved by allowing for iterative improvements on context. Examples of additional follow-up guidelines or requests include but are not limited to the following.

Review the guidelines in the [Prompt engineering best practices document](https://example.com) and refer to the notes you listed in Step 4 about how the AI tool output could better meet your needs. Then, in this step, you will add context to the output by writing more detailed follow-up requests and specifying how the context should be improved.

- **Add details:** Make the instructions in your prompt to generate a visual output for your target market. The provided context is very broad and generic. When writing a follow-up request, include details specific to your data’s industry and use a different prompt.
  - For example: **Recommend different types of data visualizations that would be effective for an insurance company's quarterly performance review over the last 12 months.**

- **Add context:** Supply more information about the task to help the tool provide better results.
  - For example: **Provide a breakdown of the selected S&P 500 companies. I need to include revenue versus projected revenue for the past 12 months.**

- **Add a specific goal:** Include the final goal or specify the outcome that you need. For instance, you could specify that you want to generate a visualization of specific data metrics or highlight certain industry trends.
  - For example: **Your visualization should be tailored to financial investors focused on buying and selling stocks from the S&P 500.**

- **Reflect on whether the prompt meets your needs:** Give specific feedback and notes from the output, such as numbers listed or ordered by priority.
  - For example: **Provide a breakdown of related data visualization recommendations.**

- **Add specificity:** This helps provide details on the context for all stakeholders who are not professionals in the field. When giving the tool a prompt, help it focus on specific examples—so your stakeholders can understand the context of your prompt and follow-up.
  - For example: **Provide a recommendation for what I should show in my final visualization for an investment bank.**

- **Specify length:** Ask for a short or long output to give the tool an idea of the ideal length of the response.
  - For example: **Make sure the recommendations should be a minimum of 25 responses of data visualizations commonly used in financial reports.**

Reflect on the analysis insights that the final output gives your goals. The objective is not to get the perfect output but to get enough information for you to work with. Be sure to always check your output before using it.
