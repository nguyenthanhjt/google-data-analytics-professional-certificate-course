## Selecting and Developing a Case Study

In this course, you have options for selecting and developing a case study. You can choose one of two possible tracks.

- The first track has two cases already defined. You can pick one of these cases and follow through on the data analysis to answer the questions presented to address business problems. For more information, refer to the [track A details]().
  
- The second track allows you to design your own case study about a topic that you are interested in. You can practice all but the Act phase of the Data Analysis Process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. For more information, refer to the [track B details](#). You can also return to [The phases of data analysis and this program](#) video to review the steps of the Data Analysis Process.

After familiarizing yourself with the details of each track, refer to the information in [Choose your case study track](#) and decide which track you want to follow.
