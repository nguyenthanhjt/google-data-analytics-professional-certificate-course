# Video: Introducing the capstone project

Video transcript

- Hi there. I'm so glad you're joining me for this last part of the program.
- This is an end-of- certificate project that Coursera and other learning platforms usually call a capstone.
- The capstone brings everything you've learned together.
- You'll have the opportunity to take all of your new knowledge and put it into practice with a data analytics case study.
- In this video, we'll talk more about what that entails and how it can help you stand out during a job search.
- Case studies are practice data analytics projects.
- When you're job hunting, you might be asked to do a case study after the pre-screen call or the first interview.
- The case study is a common way for employers to assess job skills and gain insight into how you approach common data-related challenges.
- Different employers might send you different kinds of case studies.
- For example, you might be asked to clean and analyze a data set, offer a proposal around how to measure the success of a project, or figure out and define metrics of success for a specific product.
- Usually, there's a time limit for the case study you've been asked to do.
- For example, a potential employer might give you some sample data and project questions and ask you to create a presentation or memo with your recommendations in 24 to 48 hours.
- That time limit can be a little challenging.
- But the good news is, your answer to the case study doesn't have to be perfect.
- What's important is that you show off your thought process so that the interviewers can understand how you approach the problem.
- You can use the data analysis process we've learned throughout this program to guide you.
- Let's check out an example and break down all of the parts.
- This case study has all of the information we'd need to perform this task.
- It starts here, with the title and the industry focus: predicting employee attrition rate for human resources.
- It also includes a problem statement outlining what the overall goal is.
- In this case, they're asking for a deep dive into key data analytics concepts to predict the employee attrition rate in the organization, and which factors influence an employee to leave the organization.
- Basically, this case study is interested in predicting the rate at which employees might leave the organization and why.
- There's some more specific goals in the next section.
- It's asking us to find the probability of an employee leaving the company over the next five years.
- That's pretty straightforward, but they're also interested in ways to improve employee retention.
- This next section is really key.
- The deliverables are what we'll actually give them once we've completed the case study.
- In this example, they're asking for a presentation outlining our findings and recommendations.
- Finally, they've included some sections about the data we'll use for this task.
- Here, it's a dataset that we can download.
- Now we know more about case studies and how they might be presented to us in a job application process.
- But people who are passionate about data analytics will sometimes do case studies on their own time and add them to a personal portfolio.
- A portfolio is a collection of case studies that can be shared with potential employers.
- Portfolios can be stored on public websites like GitHub, Kaggle, or Tableau, or on your blog.
- Your portfolio can also be linked in your resume.
- This will give you examples of how you approached data tasks in the past that you can talk about in your interview.
- These portfolios showcase your skills and help you stand out in job applications.
- On top of the case study, we'll talk about building your portfolio and how to share it.
- This will be a great building block that you can use to build up your resume.
- Coming up, we'll check out some great examples of case studies and portfolios that will hopefully inspire you as you start your own.
