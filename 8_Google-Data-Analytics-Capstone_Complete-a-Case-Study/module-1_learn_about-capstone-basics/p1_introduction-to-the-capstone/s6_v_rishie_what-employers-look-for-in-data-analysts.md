# Video: Rishie: What employers look for in data analysts

Video transcript

- Google is a company that's built on data.
- It's all data-driven.
- And the idea behind it is that every person, whether you're an engineer, whether you're a marketer, a seller, or even you're working in admin, where you're handling logistics and paperwork and payrolls, everybody is dealing with data in some form or the other.
- We're trying to acknowledge the fact that in any occupation across the globe, across various industries, having a knack and understanding of data is going to be crucial for everyone.
- When you are in an interview, what I personally look for, what even my colleagues look for is the way they think about this creatively.
- When people hear the word "data analyst," they think about engineers or someone who is extremely technical, and it's all about working with data and numbers.
- But I implore people to rethink about that perception that being a data analyst is not being a scientist, but that it's also being an artist.
- The entire world is your canvas.
- The way that you approach it and even sometimes challenge the traditional norms of solving a problem, I think that seems to be very powerful, and it actually puts you on the edge as compared to other people when you're interviewing for such roles.
- There's a misconception or a myth that when you're applying for a job, you should know all the right answers.
- You should answer every question that they ask correctly.
- But that's false.
- What every interviewer is looking for is how you think, what's your thought process, what is your way of looking at a certain problem, and how do you approach solving those problems.
- When you express that, I mean, you talk a little bit more about how you think about in a certain perspective, why you think about in a certain perspective, it speaks a lot about you as a person and also what's your professional capability to be in that position.
- One of the fascinating things about being a data analyst is you are a storyteller.
- You look at the data and every data point out there has a story to tell.
- If you are able to perfect that skill, you can tell some amazing stories.
- What people will remember is not just the data, but how you tell those stories to the people or to your audience.
- If you talk about the core essence of the story that this is what the data is telling me, or this is what the data tells you to do, you become a lot more successful.
- And I guarantee you that you will progress in being a data analyst and your career will prosper indefinitely.
- My name is Rishie, and I'm the Global Analytics Skills Curriculum Manager.
