# Practice Quiz: Data journal: Prepare for your project

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you’ll complete an entry in your data journal. In this journal entry, you will begin to think about and prepare for your upcoming capstone project. Throughout each course in the Google Data Analytics Certificate, you have developed the skills you’ll need to begin a career in data analytics. Now, you will apply these skills to your own in-depth capstone project. This project is designed to be similar to a data analytics case study, so completing it will provide you with valuable experience and a compelling addition to your portfolio.

## Step by step instruction

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then answer the question at the end of the activity before going to the next course item.

Data Journal

Instructions

You may use this document as a template for Journal Entry activities in this course. Additionally, you can use the templates to take notes on what you’ve learned or just to jot down your thoughts about data analytics. 
With every data journal entry, we recommend that you include some basic information to make it easier for you to come back and read your responses later. Adding the date to your journal entry and including the prompt will help you make sense of your responses later on. You can come back and reread them to understand how your opinions on different topics may have changed throughout the courses. 
Below is an example of a completed journal entry to serve as a practical guide to your own journaling activities. 

| Date   | Jan 1 |
|--------|-------|
| Course/topic | Course 1: Data, data everywhere |
| Prompt | What does the word “data” mean to you? |
| Journal Entry | When I think of data, I think of records and information. Data is a digital record. It could be a record of a sale, GPS records of where a car has been, or posts of images and pictures on social media. Data in itself isn’t useful, because there’s so much of it. However, enough data usually contains information and patterns. This information is valuable, and data analysts are the ones who extract it. |
| Other thoughts or questions | The amount of data that is created each year gets bigger and bigger! Data is important! Nowadays, companies that don’t use their data are at a disadvantage to those that do. |

| Prompt                      |   |
| Journal Entry               |   |
| Other thoughts or questions |   |

### Step 2: Start a new journal entry

Once you have opened your new or existing data journal document, start a new journal entry and name it “Journal Entry: Prepare for your capstone project.” 

As you begin, evaluate your goals and expectations for the capstone. Consider:

- What do you hope to take away from this capstone project? What is one important skill you think you’ll learn?
- Which skills do you most look forward to demonstrating?
- What are some issues you might encounter?

### Reflection

Now, write 3-5 sentences (60-100 words) in response to the previous questions. At the end of this course, review your responses and observe how your understanding of data analytics projects has changed. What did you learn? How will you use the lessons you learned in future data analytics projects?

**Did you complete this activity?**
