# Discussion Prompt: Introduce yourself

Now that you have completed the first seven courses of this program, it is time for you to take on the Data Analytics Capstone. A capstone project is a valuable opportunity for you to put into practice all of the skills you have learned. You will use it to create an original case study that you can add to your portfolio and share with potential employers.

Write 100-150 words introducing yourself. Then, add 150-200 words about why you think employers would be interested in your portfolio as a sample of your work. When you are finished, visit the [discussion forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/discussions) to read what others have written, and respond to at least two posts with your own thoughts.

**Introduction:**

Hey everyone! I'm Thanh Bui, and I'm super excited to dive into the Data Analytics Capstone with all of you. Throughout the last seven courses, I've been soaking up all sorts of cool stuff about data analysis. Coming from a software engineering background, I'm really passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and make things better for people.

**Why Employers Would Be Interested in My Portfolio:**

My portfolio isn't just about showing off my tech skills. It's a journey that reflects my transition from software engineering to the world of data analytics. It's about how I've grown and learned along the way. Employers will see that I'm not just good at crunching numbers; I'm also great at explaining what they mean and am always hungry to learn more. So, when they look at my portfolio, they'll see someone who's not just about getting the job done but also about growing and improving every step of the way.
Good luck to all of you in your Data career.
