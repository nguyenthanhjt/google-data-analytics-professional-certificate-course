# Capstone - Case Study 1: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

## Introduction

### Scenario

I am assuming to be/play the role as a junior data analyst working in
the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in
Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my
team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use
Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a
new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But
first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they
must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

### Background

**Cyclistic Overview**

Cyclistic is a bike-share program with more than 5,800 bicycles and 600
docking stations in Chicago. It offers a variety of bikes, including
reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it inclusive
for people with disabilities. While most riders use traditional bikes,
8% use assistive options. About 30% of users ride for commuting, while
the rest ride for leisure.

**Company History**

Cyclistic launched in 2016 and has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles
geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.
Riders can unlock bikes from one station and return them to any other in
the system.

**Marketing Strategy**

Cyclistic has relied on building general awareness with flexible pricing
plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Finance analysts have concluded that annual members are more profitable
than casual riders. Therefore, the goal is to convert casual riders into
annual members.

**Objective**

Moreno, the director of marketing, has set a clear goal: Design
marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. The
marketing analyst team needs to analyze Cyclistic’s historical bike trip
data to identify trends and make data-driven recommendations.

## Data Analysis Process

This case study follows the 6 steps of the Data Analysis process: ASK,
PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, and ACT. R and RStudio are utilized
for data analysis due to the large dataset size.

## 1. ASK

**Main Objective**

To understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes
differently.

**Business Tasks**

-   Identify the business task: What attracts casual riders to become
    annual members?
-   Consider key stakeholders:
    -   Director of Marketing, Moreno: Responsible for developing
        campaigns and initiatives.
    -   Executive Team: Will approve the recommended marketing program.
    -   Analytics Team: Collects, analyzes, and reports data for the
        marketing strategy.

**Deliverables**

-   A clear statement of the business task: Identify key factors that
    attract riders to become annual members.
-   Problem Statement: How do annual members and casual riders use
    Cyclistic bikes differently?
-   Insights for Business Decisions: Identify differences to define and
    design a marketing campaign to attract more members and increase
    profits.

## 2. PREPARE

**Key Tasks**

-   Download and store data appropriately.
-   Identify how it’s organized.
-   Sort and filter the data.
-   Determine the credibility of the data.

**Guiding Questions**

-   **Credibility and Bias:** The data is reliable, original,
    comprehensive, current, and cited, provided by Lyft Bikes and
    Scooters, LLC.
-   **Licensing, Privacy, Security, Accessibility:** The data is open
    and maintained by Motivate International Inc., following the Data
    License Agreement on [Divvy
    Bikes](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
-   **Data Integrity:** The data was examined and verified for
    consistency in columns and data types.
-   **Relevance:** The data helps analyze both annual members and casual
    riders, providing insights into their characteristics and bike
    usage.

**Data Source**

Cyclistic’s historical data from 2013 to 2024, available
[here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

## Data Organization

The data consists of CSV files organized by quarters from 2013 to 2019
and by month from 2020 to 2024. The analysis focuses on data from 2023,
with 12 files named `YYYYMM-divvy-tripdata.csv`.

**Columns:**

-   `ride_id`: Ride identifier
-   `rideable_type`: Type of bike
-   `started_at`: Start time
-   `ended_at`: End time
-   `start_station_id`, `start_station_name`, `start_lat`, `start_lng`:
    Start station details
-   `end_station_id`, `end_station_name`, `end_lat`, `end_lng`: End
    station details
-   `member_casual`: Member type (casual or annual)

## PREPARE: step by step

Firstly, we would need to install & load the packages required for this
process, which in this case will be: Tidyverse, Janitor & Lubridate.

``` r
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('janitor')
install.packages('lubridate')
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
```

Subsequently, we need to collect data from downloaded data files. The
data is stored in .zip files, so we have to extract them. As I chose the
2023 dataset, I will get 12 .csv files, one file representing one month
of trip data. We will use the function `read.csv()` of package:utils to
import CSV files into RStudio. Before this, we must know the working
directory to input the right path of CSV files as parameters to
`read.csv()`

``` r
# Get working directory
getwd() 

# Set working directory
setwd("./input-data/") 

# Read data files
m01 <- read.csv("./input-data/202301-divvy-tripdata.csv")
m02 <- read.csv("./input-data/202302-divvy-tripdata.csv")
m03 <- read.csv("./input-data/202303-divvy-tripdata.csv")
m04 <- read.csv("./input-data/202304-divvy-tripdata.csv")
m05 <- read.csv("./input-data/202305-divvy-tripdata.csv")
m06 <- read.csv("./input-data/202306-divvy-tripdata.csv")
m07 <- read.csv("./input-data/202307-divvy-tripdata.csv")
m08 <- read.csv("./input-data/202308-divvy-tripdata.csv")
m09 <- read.csv("./input-data/202309-divvy-tripdata.csv")
m10 <- read.csv("./input-data/202310-divvy-tripdata.csv")
m11 <- read.csv("./input-data/202311-divvy-tripdata.csv")
m12 <- read.csv("./input-data/202312-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```

Examine datasets: all datasets have the same column names & data types

``` r
str(m01)
str(m02)
str(m03)
str(m04)
str(m05)
str(m06)
str(m07)
str(m08)
str(m09)
str(m10)
str(m11)
str(m12)
```

All 12 datasets have 13 columns with the same data types: - `ride_id` :
character - `rideable_type` : character - `started_at` : character -
`ended_at` : character - `start_station_name`: character -
`start_station_id` : character - `end_station_name` : character -
`end_station_id` : character - `start_lat` : number - `start_lng` :
number - `end_lat` : number - `end_lng` : number - `member_casual` :
character

Merge the 12 datasets into one data frame

``` r
# Combine all data frames into one
cyclistic_data <- bind_rows(m01, m02, m03, m04, m05, m06, m07, m08, m09, m10, m11, m12)
```

Clean and Transform Data:

``` r
# Clean column names
cyclistic_data <- clean_names(cyclistic_data)

# Convert date columns to datetime
cyclistic_data <- cyclistic_data %>%
  mutate(started_at = ymd_hms(started_at),
         ended_at = ymd_hms(ended_at))

# Calculate ride length and day of the week
cyclistic_data <- cyclistic_data %>%
  mutate(ride_length = as.numeric(difftime(ended_at, started_at, units = "mins")),
         day_of_week = wday(started_at, label = TRUE))

# Remove any NA or negative ride lengths
cyclistic_data <- cyclistic_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(ride_length) & ride_length > 0)

cyclistic_data <- drop_na(cyclistic_data)

# Remove duplicate rows based on ride_id
initial_rows <- nrow(cyclistic_data)
cyclistic_data <- cyclistic_data[!duplicated(cyclistic_data$ride_id), ]
final_rows <- nrow(cyclistic_data)
print(paste("Removed", initial_rows - final_rows, "duplicate rows"))

# Examine the cleaned data
glimpse(cyclistic_data)
```

## 3. PROCESS

**Key Tasks**

-   Check the data for errors.
-   Choose tools.
-   Transform the data so you can work with it effectively.
-   Document the cleaning process.

## 4. ANALYZE

**Key Tasks**

-   Aggregate the data.
-   Organize and format the data.
-   Perform calculations.
-   Identify trends and relationships.

**Analysis Steps:**

Descriptive Analysis:

``` r
avg_ride_length <- cyclistic_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  summarise(mean_ride_length = mean(ride_length),
            median_ride_length = median(ride_length),
            max_ride_length = max(ride_length),
            min_ride_length = min(ride_length))

print(avg_ride_length)
```

Ride Count by Day of the Week:

``` r
ride_count_by_day <- cyclistic_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n(),
            average_ride_length = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  arrange(member_casual, day_of_week)

print(ride_count_by_day)
```

Start and End Station Usage:

``` r
station_usage <- cyclistic_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, start_station_name, end_station_name) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n(),
            average_ride_length = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_of_rides))

print(head(station_usage, 20))
```

## 5. SHARE

**Key Tasks**

-   Determine the best way to share findings.
-   Create effective data visualizations.
-   Present findings.
-   Ensure work is accessible.

**Visualizations:**

1.  **Average Ride Length by Member Type:**

``` r
ggplot(avg_ride_length, aes(x = member_casual, y = mean_ride_length, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average Ride Length by Member Type",
       x = "Member Type",
       y = "Average Ride Length (minutes)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

  ![](./visualizations/case-study-1_average-ride-length-by-member-type.png)

2.  **Ride Count by Day of the Week:**

``` r
ggplot(ride_count_by_day, aes(x = day_of_week, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Ride Count by Day of the Week",
       x = "Day of the Week",
       y = "Number of Rides") +
  theme_minimal()
```

  ![](./visualizations/case-study-1_ride-count-by-day-of-the-week.png)

3.  **Popular Start and End Stations:**

``` r
top_stations <- station_usage %>% 
  filter(member_casual %in% c("member", "casual")) %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  top_n(10, number_of_rides)

ggplot(top_stations, aes(x = reorder(start_station_name, -number_of_rides), y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top Start Stations by Member Type",
       x = "Start Station",
       y = "Number of Rides") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](./visualizations/case-study-1_popular-start-n-end-stations-by-member-type.png)

**Sharing Findings:**

1.  **Average Ride Length by Member Type:**
    -   Casual riders have a significantly longer average ride length
        (28.3 minutes) compared to annual members (12.5 minutes). This
        suggests casual riders may be using the bikes for leisure or
        longer trips, while annual members likely use them for shorter,
        more frequent trips such as commuting.
2.  **Ride Count by Day of the Week:**
    -   Casual riders have higher ride counts on weekends, especially
        Saturdays and Sundays. In contrast, annual members have a more
        consistent ride count throughout the week, with slight increases
        on weekdays, particularly Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
3.  **Popular Start and End Stations by Member Type:**
    -   Popular start and end stations vary significantly between casual
        riders and annual members. Stations like "DuSable Lake Shore Dr
        & Monroe St" and "Streeter Dr & Grand Ave" are highly frequented
        by casual riders, while annual members show a more distributed
        usage across various stations.

## 6. ACT

**Key Tasks**

-   Prepare a comprehensive report with all findings, insights, and
    visualizations.
-   Create a presentation to share with key stakeholders, ensuring data
    is accessible and understandable.
-   Use insights gained to make actionable recommendations for the
    marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual
    members.

**Recommendations and Actions:**

1.  **Targeted Marketing Campaigns:**
    -   **Leisure Focus:** Since casual riders tend to have longer ride
        durations and higher usage on weekends, create marketing
        campaigns focused on leisure activities. Highlight benefits such
        as weekend ride packages, scenic routes, and leisure ride
        events.
    -   **Commute Focus:** For annual members who primarily use bikes
        for commuting, emphasize the convenience and cost savings of an
        annual membership. Promote benefits such as faster commute
        times, dedicated bike lanes, and easy access to docking stations
        near business districts.
2.  **Station Optimization:**
    -   **Casual Rider Stations:** Enhance and promote stations popular
        among casual riders, such as "DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St"
        and "Streeter Dr & Grand Ave." Ensure these stations are
        well-maintained and have ample bikes available on weekends.
    -   **Annual Member Stations:** Optimize stations used by annual
        members for daily commutes. Provide amenities such as quick bike
        check-outs and returns, well-lit areas, and proximity to public
        transit options.
3.  **Membership Incentives:**
    -   Offer incentives for casual riders to become annual members.
        Examples include:
        -   Discounted annual memberships after a certain number of
            single rides.
        -   Free trials of annual membership benefits.
        -   Special promotions during peak riding seasons.
4.  **Community Engagement:**
    -   Organize community events and rides to engage both casual riders
        and annual members. Events such as community bike rides,
        maintenance workshops, and social gatherings can help foster a
        sense of community and loyalty.

**Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Timeline:**
    -   Develop a detailed timeline for the implementation of marketing
        campaigns, station optimizations, and membership incentives.
    -   Assign responsibilities to team members for each task and set
        clear deadlines.
2.  **Budget:**
    -   Allocate a budget for marketing campaigns, station improvements,
        and membership incentive programs.
    -   Track spending and ensure initiatives remain cost-effective.
3.  **Monitoring and Evaluation:**
    -   Set up key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor the
        effectiveness of the implemented strategies.
    -   Regularly review data to assess the impact on membership
        conversions and make adjustments as needed.
4.  **Feedback Loop:**
    -   Collect feedback from riders through surveys and social media to
        continuously improve the bike-share program.
    -   Use feedback to refine marketing messages, improve station
        amenities, and enhance the overall rider experience.
