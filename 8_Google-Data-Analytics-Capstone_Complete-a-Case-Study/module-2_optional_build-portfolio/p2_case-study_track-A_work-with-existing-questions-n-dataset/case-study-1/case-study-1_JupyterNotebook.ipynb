The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\"\n",

It offers a variety of bikes, including reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it inclusive for people with disabilities. While most riders use traditional bikes, 8% use assistive options. About 30% of users ride for commuting, while the rest ride for leisure.\\n\\n**Company History**\\n\\nCyclistic launched in 2016 and has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. Riders can unlock bikes from one station and return them to any other in the system.\\n\\n**Marketing Strategy**\\n\\nCyclistic has relied on building general awareness with flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Finance analysts have concluded that annual members are more profitable than casual riders. Therefore, the goal is to convert casual riders into annual members.\\n\\n**Objective**\\n\\nMoreno, the director of marketing, has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. The marketing analyst team needs to analyze Cyclistic’s historical bike trip data to identify trends and make data-driven recommendations.\"\n",
