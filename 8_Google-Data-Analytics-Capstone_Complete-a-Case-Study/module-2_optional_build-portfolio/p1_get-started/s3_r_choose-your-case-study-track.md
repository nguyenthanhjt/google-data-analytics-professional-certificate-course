# Choose Your Case Study Track

A case study is a common way for employers to assess your skills and observe how you approach a data-related project. You might be tasked with tasks such as cleaning and analyzing a dataset, creating a proposal to measure the success of a project, or defining success metrics for a project.

In this course, you have the opportunity to work with a case study through one of two tracks:

|Track A: Working with Existing Questions and Datasets|Track B: Choosing Your Own Questions and Dataset|
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
|Demonstrate job skills for future interviews using a given dataset for analysis.|Create a more flexible portfolio piece about a personal interest that you have.|

## [Track A](../p2_case-study_track-A_work-with-existing-questions-n-dataset/s1_r_track-A-details.md)

If you select Track A, you can choose from these two options to complete your case study requirement:

- **Case study: Cyclistic bike-share analysis**

This is an opportunity to analyze historical bicycle trip data in order to identify trends. Understanding how casual riders behave differently from riders with paid memberships is important. This analysis will help executives to make decisions about marketing programs and strategies to convert casual riders to riders with annual memberships. Refer to [Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?](../p2_case-study_track-A_work-with-existing-questions-n-dataset/s2_r_how-does-a-bike-share-navigate-speedy-success.md) for more details about this case study

- **Case study: Bellabeat product analysis**

This is an opportunity to analyze publicly available fitness tracker data in order to gain insights into how consumers are using these products. Identifying any trends in this data will be key. This will help Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, determine marketing strategy in the future. Refer to [Case Study 2: How can a wellness company play it smart?](../p2_case-study_track-A_work-with-existing-questions-n-dataset/s3_r_how-can-a-wellness-company-play-it-smart.md) for more details about this case study.

## [Track B](../p3_case-study_track-B_choose-your-own-questions-n-dataset/s1_r_track-B-detail.md)

If you select Track B, you must search for a public dataset that focuses on an area of interest to you. Are you interested in housing the homeless? Are you interested in conserving open spaces for public use? Are you interested in figuring out if Bitcoin is a good investment? Track B gives you freedom to investigate anything that you like, but it does assume that you will be self-directed to develop your own case study from scratch. You will need to come up with all the requirements for the analysis.
