# Video: Get started with your case study

Video transcript

- Hello! Great to see you again.
- Now that we've checked out some example case studies and portfolios, it's time to start creating your own.
- Coming up, you'll do an activity that'll help you get started.
- But before that, I wanted to tell you a little bit about the different approaches you can use to start your project.
- There's two possible tracks you can use to frame out your case study and help you get started.
- In Track 1, you'll be able to choose a business question similar to the kind that interviewers might ask.
- There are several different options for you to choose from, with specific business tasks and different datasets for you to use.
- In Track 2, you'll be asked to find a public dataset to explore something you're personally interested in.
- This could be anything.
- From analyzing a video game you like, to a study on a wildlife population you care about.
- This is the more flexible option, and you'll have more freedom to build something that's really personal to you.
- Depending on what you want to do with your case study, you might choose one over the other.
- For example, if you want to create a case study that you can use to demonstrate your job skills for future interviews, then Track 1 might be more useful for you but if you have something you're personally interested in that you'd like to explore more, Track 2 can help you build a flexible portfolio piece.
- Or if you're interested in Track 1 and 2, you can do both.
- Once you've decided on the track you're most interested in, you'll use the case study outline to help you start your project.
- The outline follows the phases of the data analysis lifecycle that we've been using throughout this program.
- You'll complete each phase from asking the right questions to preparing, processing, and analyzing your data, until you finally build your presentation and share it in your portfolio.
- Each phase will have key questions and activities to help guide you through the process.
- If you ever need to review something, you can always go back to any part of the program to help you.
- As a quick reminder, the data you'll be working with for this project will be public and open-source.
- This data is great for demonstrating your skills as a data analyst but it's essential to avoid plagiarism by citing your sources.
- Public, open-source data can be easily searched, and we don't want to pass it off as our own work.
- Plagiarism can have serious negative consequences, legally and personally.
- The beauty of our work as data analysts is that we can share and collaborate with each other.
- So let's remember to give credit to our sources.
- I hope you're excited about starting your case study.
- I'm really excited to see what you'll put together.
- After this, you'll be able to start working on the outline.
- Then we've got some other activities that'll help guide you.
- After that, we'll talk about sharing your portfolio.
- Good luck.
