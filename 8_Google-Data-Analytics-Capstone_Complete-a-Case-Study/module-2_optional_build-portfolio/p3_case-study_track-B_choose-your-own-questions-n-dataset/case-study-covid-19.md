# An analysis of Covid 19

Hi everyone,

I have started working on my own case study for the "Choose Your Own Adventure" track. This case study allows me to select a topic and dataset that interests me, and I've decided to analyze COVID-19 data. My goal is to define a business task, analyze the data, and provide actionable insights and recommendations.

## Progress and Insights

1. **Defining the Business Task**:
   - I have identified the business task, which is to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on various metrics such as infection rates, mortality rates, vaccination rates, and economic indicators. This task aims to provide insights and recommendations for public health policy and economic recovery.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - I have selected COVID-19 datasets from sources like Johns Hopkins University and Our World in Data. The data includes daily counts of cases, deaths, and vaccinations, as well as demographic and economic indicators. I have downloaded and organized the data appropriately, ensuring it is clean and ready for analysis.

### Challenges and Questions

1. **Data Integration**:
   - What are some effective methods for integrating multiple COVID-19 data sources to provide a comprehensive analysis? How do you ensure consistency and reliability when combining different datasets?

2. **Trend Analysis**:
   - What techniques or metrics are best for identifying and analyzing trends in COVID-19 infection and vaccination rates over time? Are there specific statistical models or visualization techniques that you recommend for highlighting key patterns?

3. **Impact Assessment**:
   - How can I effectively assess the impact of COVID-19 on economic indicators such as unemployment rates, GDP, and business closures? What methods or frameworks are useful for linking public health data with economic outcomes?

4. **Geospatial Analysis**:
   - What are the best practices for conducting geospatial analysis on COVID-19 data to understand regional variations in infection rates, vaccination uptake, and healthcare resource allocation? Are there specific tools or techniques that are particularly effective for this type of analysis?

5. **Communicating Findings**:
   - What are some best practices for presenting complex COVID-19 data insights to policymakers and the general public? How do you ensure that your visualizations and findings are easily understandable and impactful?

Discussing these aspects with others will help me refine my approach and gain new insights into effectively analyzing and presenting the data.

Thank you in advance for your help!
