# Reading: Create your online portfolio

This reading provides a checklist about what to include in your portfolio, where you can set up accounts to host your portfolio, and how to add content to your portfolio.

## What to Include

You learned that a portfolio represents your skills and showcases some of your previous projects to potential employers. Keep your portfolio:

- **Personal:** Show who you are, what you are interested in, and what is important to you.
- **Simple:** Display your work with easy navigation and without cluttered pages.
- **Relevant:** Match your work to the skills included in job descriptions.
- **Presentable:** Emphasize quality in the samples you show.
- **Unique:** Showcase your own work; cite sources of content to avoid plagiarism.

## Where to Set Up Accounts

Choose a platform to host your portfolio. Medium, Google Sites, and WordPress are good for blogging. GitHub and Kaggle are better for code. And finally, as you know, Tableau is great for visualizations. Next, create an account on the platform that you chose. Check out these steps to set up accounts on various platforms:

- Set up an account on [GitHub](https://github.com)
