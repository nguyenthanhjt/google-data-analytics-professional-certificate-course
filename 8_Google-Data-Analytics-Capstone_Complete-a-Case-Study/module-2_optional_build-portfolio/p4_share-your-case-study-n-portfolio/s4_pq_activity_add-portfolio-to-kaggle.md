# Practice Quiz: Hands-On Activity: Add your portfolio to Kaggle

## Activity Overview

Earlier in this course, you learned about what to put in an effective data analyst portfolio. In this activity, you will add your portfolio content to a Kaggle notebook.

As you create your data analytics portfolio, you might find yourself using Kaggle or another online platform to host it. Kaggle hosts interactive notebooks that let you showcase your programming and hard work. If you have an existing portfolio, you can copy your content into Kaggle to have an additional way to share it.

By the time you complete this activity, you will have created a Kaggle notebook containing your portfolio content. Then you can easily share your work with a Kaggle link, enabling you to send your portfolio to more people.

## Step 1: Review type of Kaggle NoteBooks

First, it’s helpful to know the different kinds of Notebooks on Kaggle. Every kind of Kaggle Notebook uses code, but each one contains different languages for programming or writing text. The different types include: 

- Scripts: Typically, these are code-only documents. Cells can be formatted in R or Python, and they execute each cell as code sequentially. 
- RMarkdown scripts: Cells can be formatted in R and RMarkdown. These files are preferred by many R authors.
- Jupyter Notebooks: Cells can be formatted in Markdown, R, or Python. These are the most flexible.

Before you create a Notebook in Kaggle, decide which kind of Notebook you intend to use.

To share the code you wrote in this course, choose a Kaggle Notebook that supports R and Markdown, such as an R Markdown script or a Jupyter Notebook.

## Step 2: Add R to yout Notebook

1. To begin, log in to Kaggle and go to [Kaggle.com/code](https://www.kaggle.com/code).

2. Select + Create and select < > New Notebook to create a new notebook. If you want to use an existing notebook, go to the Your work tab and scroll to the notebook you want to use.

3. Decide whether to use a type of script or a Jupyter notebook based on your project’s needs. The editor will begin as a notebook by default. If you want to change your notebook to a script, click on File at the top of your editor and hover over Editor Type. This opens a drop-down menu to select Notebook or Script. For this activity, select Notebook.

4. Because the work you did in the last course was in R instead of Python, you need to change the notebook’s language. Select File at the top of your editor and hover over Language. This opens a dropdown menu with both options available. Select R if it isn’t selected already.

5. Open the file of a project you want to use in your portfolio. This can be the capstone project you completed during this course, an earlier activity you completed in a past course, or a personal project you created. Ideally, this project should demonstrate your coding ability and your data analytics knowledge. 

6. Add the content of your portfolio piece. Copy the code you wrote into R cells and copy regular text or images into Markdown cells. To add a cell to the document, select + Code or + Markdown. It helps to test your code in the Kaggle interface by running it periodically as you write or copy it in. This way, you ensure that it doesn’t return an error.

7. Repeat steps 2-6 to upload your portfolio pieces to their own Kaggle notebooks.

You have now created (or duplicated) your portfolio in Kaggle! Your next step is to publish your portfolio.

## Step 3: Publishe portfolio

Now it’s time to publicly publish your portfolio on Kaggle. This will allow peers, hiring managers, and potential employers to view your skill set and provide feedback.

Note: When you publish your portfolio, you will also need to publicize all documents associated with it. For example, if you include a link to a document on Google Drive, you will need to ensure it is also publicly viewable.

1. To begin, navigate to the Your work tab on the Code screen to bring you to the list of your notebooks and scripts.

2. Select the first notebook or script you’d like to publicize. At the top right-hand corner, click the Share button.

3. If the Share window indicates that the document is private, click the button next to the Public option.

    Once your project is public, you’ll be able to add relevant tags or any collaborators who contributed to the document. You can use tags to describe the topics your work relates to. [Click here](https://www.kaggle.com/tags) to learn more about which tags you can use on Kaggle.

4. Repeat these steps until you’ve made each piece in your portfolio public on Kaggle. 

    You have now uploaded your portfolio to Kaggle and can share your accomplishments with colleagues, hiring managers, and potential employers. You can update your portfolio as your skills as a data analyst continue to grow.

    Now, share your portfolio by going to the Your work tab on Kaggle, selecting the project you’d like to share, and copying the URL from the address bar. Share this link to show the world your hard work!

## Reflection

### Question 1: Suppose you want to add a description of your code to your Kaggle notebook. What button will enable you to create the proper cell?

- [ ] Description
- [ ] Code
- [ ] Markdown
- [ ] Text

### Question 2: In this activity, you created or duplicated your portfolio on Kaggle. In the text box below, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of the following questions:

- What is an advantage of using Kaggle as a platform for your portfolio?
- Is there another platform you will use as well as or instead of Kaggle?
- Now that you are about to finish the final course in the Google Data Analytics Certificate, which activities and projects from the course will be most effective for your portfolio?

An advantage of using Kaggle as a platform for my portfolio is that it allows me to showcase my data analysis skills in an interactive environment, making it easier for potential employers to view and run the code. Additionally, Kaggle’s community features enable you to gain visibility and feedback from other data professionals.

Besides Kaggle, I plan to use GitHub to host my portfolio. GitHub is widely recognized in the industry and allows me to manage and version control my projects effectively. Using both platforms will help me reach a broader audience and demonstrate my versatility.

The most effective activities and projects for my portfolio will be the capstone project and the case studies. These projects provide comprehensive examples of my ability to analyze data, derive insights, and present findings, which are critical skills for a data analyst role.
