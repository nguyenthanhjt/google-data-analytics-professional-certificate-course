## Video transcript

**Interviewer (Jordan):** Well, Sally, we've been very impressed with you throughout this process. Although you have limited experience working as a data analyst, I'm really confident in your abilities and I think your past experience coupled with your current certificate will make you an excellent junior data analyst. So with that being said, I would like to officially offer you a position with us.

**Applicant (Sally):** Oh my gosh, thank you so much, Jordan. That's fantastic news.

**Interviewer (Jordan):** Well, as we established earlier, this role has a starting salary of $50 thousand, and of course you will be getting health care benefits, stock options in the company, paid time off, all of that as part of our hiring package.

**Applicant (Sally):** That sounds great. Can I take some time and think about the offer?

**Interviewer (Jordan):** Of course. I'm going to send you everything so you can take a more comprehensive look, and feel free to email or call me with any questions.

**Applicant (Sally):** Amazing. Thanks so much for the offer, Jordan, I promise to get back to you soon with my answer.

**Interviewer (Jordan):** Thanks, Sally, and I look forward to your response.

**Applicant (Sally):** Hi, Jordan.

**Interviewer (Jordan):** Hi, Sally, it's great to hear from you. Have you given more thought to our offer?

**Applicant (Sally):** Yes, I have. I know this is an entry-level position, but I believe that based on transferable past experience that I'll be bringing to the table, my compensation should be higher than $50K.

**Interviewer (Jordan):** I understand, and can you remind me what your initial ask was?

**Applicant (Sally):** I asked for a base salary between $58-60K.

**Interviewer (Jordan):** So with the salary that you're looking for, it is a little bit higher than the average. Can you tell me more about what skills and experience you feel support that range?

**Applicant (Sally):** I understand, and I'd love for us to agree on a competitive salary based on the skills and experience I'll be bringing in. In terms of my experience, I'll be particularly strong in the communications department after managing difficult customers and rowdy kids. Furthermore, due to my diverse background, I'll be able to translate complicated topics easily into understandable snippets for others who might not be as numbers-based as I am. Those are the soft skills that I'll be bringing in. In terms of hard skills, I earned the Data Analytics Certificate, where I picked up the technical tools of the trade like SQL and data visualization. So that's why I believe my experience qualifies me to having valuable and transferable skills that I can bring to the table, which is more than what an entry-level analyst with absolutely no experience would be bringing in.

**Interviewer (Jordan):** Well, I feel like that's impressive, and like I said, we think you'd be a great fit for this team. So we would like to meet you in the middle and offer you $56 thousand with obvious room for growth.

**Applicant (Sally):** I appreciate this offer and your willingness to be flexible. I think that's fair. So I'd like to officially accept the role of junior data analyst with your company.

**Interviewer (Jordan):** Wonderful. Well, I will be sending you all of the proper paperwork and get you started onboarding as soon as possible. You'll be an excellent addition, Sally. We're really glad to have you join us.

**Applicant (Sally):** Thank you, Jordan, and I'm super excited to get started.
