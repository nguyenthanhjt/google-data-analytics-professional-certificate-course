Hey, I'm Nathan.

2
00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:08.400
I'm a principal data analyst in

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.875
a trust and safety
organization at Google.

4
00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:13.410
At Google, I'm a member
of an organization

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.780
called VetNet which is

6
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.970
an employee resource group for

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.855
veterans and Googlers who
want to support veterans.

8
00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.035
One of my favorite ways that
we give back every year

9
00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:28.050
is through an annual
resume review workshop.

10
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.865
In the resume workshop,

11
00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:31.740
either virtually or in person,

12
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.210
we have veterans or

13
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.750
veteran spouses coming to

14
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.030
the office or we
meet via video chat,

15
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.570
and we go through the
resume and really focus

16
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.000
on impactful things they've
done and how to make

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.050
their accomplishments jump off

18
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.050
the page and show really
how awesome they are.

19
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.220
Veterans, in
particular, can have

20
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.160
some unique challenges
when it comes to

21
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.130
translating their
military experience to

22
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.330
a really effective
civilian resume.

23
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.305
The first is removing
military-specific jargon.

24
00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:08.270
The second is being willing

25
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.290
to claim correct credit for
the accomplishments that

26
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.745
you did because a lot of times

27
00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:15.410
veterans are going to
always say that it was

28
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.790
completely the team that did

29
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.440
it and then third
is coming up with

30
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.445
a really good measurement
of the impact

31
00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:25.685
of the activities that they're
showcasing in the resume.

32
00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:29.360
Just as service members
have to communicate really

33
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.180
clearly, work well as a
team and really exercise

34
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.680
really good attention to detail.

35
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.080
That's also the case

36
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.985
when you're working
as a data analyst.

37
00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:39.260
You can't know everything,

38
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.110
so it's important to
be able to work with

39
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.105
cross-functional stakeholders

40
00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:47.445
in a very collaborative
setting and

41
00:01:47.445 --> 00:01:49.910
the best analysis in the world is

42
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.010
worthless if you can't
clearly communicate

43
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.470
recommendations and
influence the stakeholders

44
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.020
to adopt those and
of course if you

45
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.540
overlook some important
details that could also derail

46
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.225
your analysis and
your credibility

47
00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:03.920
in the eyes of
those stakeholders.

48
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.935
Attention to detail
is critical.

49
00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:08.670
It's important to
get some training.

50
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.680
Of course, the Data Analyst
Certificate is a great set of

51
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.450
training but also
just other courses

52
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.730
either on tools that
seem interesting to you.

53
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.780
It's important to think about

54
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.490
what sorts of problems
you find the most

55
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.810
interesting, and
then find data for

56
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.130
those problems and do some
analysis on your own.

57
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.150
That's a really high-impact
way of being able to get

58
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.270
some great experience on your
own that you can then talk

59
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.250
about during interviews and

60
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.635
even informal chats with
people in your network.

61
00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:46.210
Why veterans should consider
a career in data analysis

62
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.395
is that they already
have a strong foundation

63
00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:51.380
of being able to be
really persistent while

64
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.990
also remaining really
humble and that's super

65
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.100
important as a data analyst

66
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.230
because if your ego
is out of control,

67
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.655
you're going to have
big blind spots

68
00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:01.840
that lead you to make
mistakes in your analysis.

69
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.390
One of the best pieces of
advice that I still think

70
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.340
of is that it's

71
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.555
better to get speeding
tickets than parking tickets.

72
00:03:10.555 --> 00:03:14.550
Especially means as
a data analyst is

73
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.430
sometimes you have to jump into

74
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.755
situations that you're
not totally comfortable,

75
00:03:18.755 --> 00:03:20.540
and you need to

76
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.710
learn your way out of it and

77
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.760
collaborate your way out of it.
