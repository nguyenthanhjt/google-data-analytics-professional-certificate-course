00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.820
Well, Sally we've been very

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.995
impressed with you
throughout this process.

3
00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:06.390
Although you have limited

4
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.535
experience working
as a data analyst,

5
00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:10.680
I'm really confident
in your abilities

6
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.050
and I think your past experience

7
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.450
coupled with your
current certificate will

8
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.120
make you an excellent
junior data analyst.

9
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.650
So with that being said,

10
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.420
I would like to officially
offer you a position with us.

11
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.635
Oh my gosh. Thank you so much
Jordan. That's fantastic news.

12
00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:30.975
Well, as we established earlier,

13
00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:35.160
this role has a starting
salary of $50 thousand,

14
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.710
and of course you will be
getting health care benefits,

15
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.480
stock options in the company,

16
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.355
paid time off, all of that as
part of our hiring package.

17
00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:47.595
That sounds great. Can I

18
00:00:47.595 --> 00:00:50.130
take some time and
think about the offer?

19
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.400
Of course. I'm going to send you

20
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.339
everything so you can take
a more comprehensive look,

21
00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.715
and feel free to email or
call me with any questions.

22
00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:01.940
Amazing. Thanks so
much for the offer,

23
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.270
Jordan, I promise to get back
to you soon with my answer.

24
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.000
Thanks, Sally, and I look
forward to your response.

25
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.980
Hi, Jordan.

26
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.095
Hi, Sally, it's great
to hear from you.

27
00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:18.765
Have you given more
thought to our offer?

28
00:01:18.765 --> 00:01:22.700
Yes, I have. I know this is
an entry-level position,

29
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.810
but I believe that based on

30
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.625
transferable past experience that

31
00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:27.125
I'll be bringing to the table,

32
00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:30.820
that my compensation should
be higher than 50 K.

33
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.140
I understand, and can you

34
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.170
remind me what your
initial ask was?

35
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.885
I asked for a base
salary between 58-60 K.

36
00:01:40.885 --> 00:01:43.640
So with the salary
that you're looking

37
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.310
for, it is a little bit
higher than the average.

38
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.140
Can you tell me more
about what skills and

39
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.875
experience you feel
support that range?

40
00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:53.600
I understand, and I'd
love for us to agree on

41
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.040
a competitive salary based on

42
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.440
the skills and experience
I'll be bringing in.

43
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.000
In terms of my experience,

44
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.200
I'll be particularly strong

45
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.520
in the communications department

46
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.700
after managing difficult
customers and rowdy kids.

47
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.070
Furthermore, due to my
diverse background,

48
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.010
I'll be able to translate
complicated topics easily

49
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.470
into understandable snippets for

50
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.490
others who might not be
as numbers-based as I am.

51
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.155
Those are the soft skills
that I'll be bringing in.

52
00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:19.745
In terms of hard skills,

53
00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:23.045
I earned the Data
Analytics Certificate,

54
00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:24.980
where I picked up the
technical tools of

55
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.920
the trade like SQL and
data visualization.

56
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.310
So that's why I believe my
experience qualifies me to

57
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.280
having valuable and
transferable skills

58
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.855
that I can bring to the table,

59
00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:38.330
which is more than what
an entry-level analyst

60
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.805
with absolutely no experience
would be bringing in.

61
00:02:41.805 --> 00:02:44.625
Well, I feel like
that's impressive,

62
00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:45.965
and like I said,

63
00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:48.335
we think you'd be a
great fit for this team.

64
00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:51.320
So we would like to meet
you in the middle and offer

65
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.279
you 56 thousand with
obvious room for growth.

66
00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:57.300
I appreciate this offer and

67
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.805
your willingness to be
flexible. I think that's fair.

68
00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:02.330
So I'd like to officially accept

69
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.604
the role of junior data
analyst with your company.

70
00:03:05.604 --> 00:03:08.675
Wonderful. Well, I
will be sending you

71
00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:10.640
all of the proper
paperwork and get you

72
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.505
started onboarding
as soon as possible.

73
00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:15.680
You'll be an excellent addition,

74
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.350
Sally. We're really glad
to have you join us.

75
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.890
Thank you, Jordan, and I'm
super excited to get started.
