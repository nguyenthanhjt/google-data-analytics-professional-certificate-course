## Video transcript

**Nathan:** Hey, I'm Nathan. I'm a principal data analyst in a trust and safety organization at Google. At Google, I'm a member of an organization called VetNet which is an employee resource group for veterans and Googlers who want to support veterans. One of my favorite ways that we give back every year is through an annual resume review workshop. 

In the resume workshop, either virtually or in person, we have veterans or veteran spouses coming to the office or we meet via video chat, and we go through the resume and really focus on impactful things they've done and how to make their accomplishments jump off the page and show really how awesome they are. Veterans, in particular, can have some unique challenges when it comes to translating their military experience to a really effective civilian resume.

- **Challenges for Veterans:**
  1. Removing military-specific jargon.
  2. Being willing to claim correct credit for their accomplishments, as veterans often attribute success to the team.
  3. Measuring the impact of their activities effectively.

Just as service members have to communicate clearly, work well as a team, and exercise good attention to detail, that's also the case when you're working as a data analyst. You can't know everything, so it's important to be able to work with cross-functional stakeholders in a very collaborative setting. The best analysis in the world is worthless if you can't clearly communicate recommendations and influence stakeholders to adopt them. Overlooking important details can derail your analysis and your credibility in the eyes of those stakeholders. Attention to detail is critical.

It's important to get some training. Of course, the Data Analyst Certificate is a great set of training but also just other courses either on tools that seem interesting to you. It's important to think about what sorts of problems you find the most interesting, and then find data for those problems and do some analysis on your own. That's a really high-impact way of being able to get some great experience on your own that you can then talk about during interviews and even informal chats with people in your network.

Why veterans should consider a career in data analysis is that they already have a strong foundation of being able to be really persistent while also remaining really humble. That's super important as a data analyst because if your ego is out of control, you're going to have big blind spots that lead you to make mistakes in your analysis.

One of the best pieces of advice that I still think of is that it's better to get speeding tickets than parking tickets. Especially as a data analyst, sometimes you have to jump into situations that you're not totally comfortable with, and you need to learn your way out of it and collaborate your way out of it.
