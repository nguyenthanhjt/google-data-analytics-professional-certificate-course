Itâ€™s important for you to establish the mindset of a data analyst in the real world. This part of the course prepares you to use that mindset when you talk about your case study during interviews, which will ultimately help you be successful in your interviews with recruiters and hiring managers.

In this week's content, different interview scenarios will be presented as useful examples. You will have the opportunity to:

Familiarize yourself with interview practices and questions

Develop your own strategies for using your portfolio and case study 

Create and polish your elevator pitch for your case study

Practice introducing your case study at a high level and at the right time during interviews

Access resources that will help you become more confident telling recruiters and hiring managers about your case study when you interview for data analyst roles

Your case study demonstrates fundamental skills to prospective employers and showcases what you have learned from the Google Data Analytics Certificate. But being able to present these skills and discuss your case study during interviews is also going to be key to your success!
