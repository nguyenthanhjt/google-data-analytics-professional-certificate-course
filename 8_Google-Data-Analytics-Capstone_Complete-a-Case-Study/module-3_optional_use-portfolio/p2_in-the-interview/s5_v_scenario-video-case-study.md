## Video transcript

**Interviewer (Jordan):** All right, well, let's get right into it. We sent you a case study of a hypothetical scenario where a school needs to improve its communication with parents, and we asked for basically your top insights into how this can be solved. Can you take me through your thought process?

**Applicant (Sally):** Sure. I just want to say this is such a great scenario. I really enjoyed working with it, and it's something I imagine a lot of schools have to deal with. This is what I came up with. Here's the presentation that I put together, "Bridging the Communication Gap between Teachers & Parents" for Creekside Middle School.

- The background problem was that there were sporadic or non-existing communication between teachers and parents.
- The solution that we're trying to come up with is to help the middle school design an app for parents to stay updated on school news and their children's classes and activities.

**Analytical Goals:**
- **Why:** 
  - Why do we want to create the app in the first place? 
  - Why are we interested in keeping parents informed?
  - We want to quantify the impacts of parental involvement on student test scores.

- **How:** 
  - Once we decide to create the app, what are parents interested in?
  - What do they want to learn more about?

**Findings:**
- **Why:**
  - There is a downward trend in student test scores since 2004.
  - Parental involvement dropped in 2004 despite a 14 percentage point increase in test scores when parents are involved.
  - The lack of parental involvement correlates with the drop in student test scores, making it important to increase parental involvement to improve scores.

- **How:**
  - Data from a survey categorized student activities into sports, academics, and extracurricular clubs.
  - Seventh graders received the fewest news alerts, indicating the need for more attention.
  - Recommendations:
    - Create three tabs in the app for academic, sports, and extracurricular activities.
    - Prioritize the test launch for parents of seventh graders.

**Summary:**
- **Why:** Parental involvement is highly correlated with higher test scores.
- **How:** Design the app with three activity categories and prioritize a version 1 launch for seventh graders.

**Timeline:**
- Two weeks for analysis.
- Presenting the analysis now.
- Build the app.
- Focus on seventh graders during testing and iteration.
- Launch and open the app to all grades.

**Future Improvements:**
- Explore additional questions for version 2 of the app, such as the impact of having multiple children involved in the same school or one caretaker versus multiple.

**Interviewer (Jordan):** Thank you very much. That's all I had. Well, great work, Sally. You've really covered a lot of ground in a short amount of time. Based on what you've examined, you understood the objective and captured who the client is and what they want, using data and visuals that supported your hypothesis. Can you tell me a little bit more about what you would recommend as next steps?

**Applicant (Sally):** For sure. My recommendations for next steps are twofold:
1. Share these insights with the person or the team building the app to ensure they can build an app for parents to easily navigate the three activity categories.
2. Prioritize building for seventh graders during the testing and iteration phase for the biggest impact.

**Interviewer (Jordan):** Great, well done. I really appreciate your time on this. I'll take a further look into your presentation and my notes and I'll reach out soon with my final thoughts.

**Applicant (Sally):** Thanks, Jordan. I look forward to it.
