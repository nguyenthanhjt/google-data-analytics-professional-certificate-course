# Reading: The interview process

Think of your job interview process as having four stages: introduction, skills test, compatibility, and decision-making. In this reading, you’ll review the different stages to help you better prepare. Along the way, you’ll learn more about Interview Warmup, a tool designed specifically to help you practice your interview skills. This is a great way to gain confidence before your actual interviews. 

## Interview stages

You will likely be required to go through multiple rounds of interviews. Each interview will vary in the types of questions asked and what is expected of you. Continue reading to learn about different types of interviews.

### Stage 1: Introduction (resume and portfolio)

The goal of the introductory interview is for the recruiter to get to know you. They want to find out who you are and assess your background. This is your chance to shine. Have your portfolio and resume ready and be prepared to speak concisely about your qualifications, experience, and skills using specific examples.

### Stage 2: The skill test interview (case study)

This is usually your second interview and it will often be conducted by a fellow data analyst or data engineer. In this interview, you will be given a technical assessment testing your SQL and programming skills. You will also be asked to complete a case study or a behavioral test. Your potential employer wants to know if you can do the job that you’re interviewing for, so they will be focused on getting you to demonstrate your skills. Make sure you’re prepared with well-formed answers that highlight your technical knowledge and problem-solving skills. 

### Stage 3: The compatibility interview

In some cases, there will be an additional interview to determine mutual compatibility between you and the company. To give you a comprehensive idea of what the work culture is like, the interviewer might include other members of the team during this round.

Often the goal here is to determine if you are a good fit with the rest of the team that you will be working with. This might include your peers, as well as the person you might report to. As with the introductory interview, get ready to discuss yourself more in-depth, using examples from your portfolio and resume as needed.

### Stage 4: Decision-making

When your last interview concludes, it’s advisable to ask about next steps and a timeline of when a hiring decision will be made. Take note that the process can take anywhere from four to six weeks as things are finalized.

You will likely receive one of three responses: an offer letter, a rejection letter, or no communication. Receiving a job offer is very exciting and something you can take pride in. However, don’t feel pressured or obligated to accept the first offer you receive. Feel free to ask for time to consider, do your research on a fair salary or benefits package, and be open-minded and willing to compromise.

## Build your network

Unfortunately, there are times when you will receive a rejection. Despite any disappointments you may have, responding back with a thoughtful email will create a professional relationship with that hiring manager or company. You may even stand out in a way that might benefit your career in the long run. Generally, this email should be a short thank you letter expressing your appreciation for the opportunity and for the time they spent interviewing you.

There will even be cases where you will receive no response from the hiring manager. This doesn’t necessarily mean you did not get the position and sending an inquiring follow-up email will help clear things up. However, if you indeed didn’t get the position, then simply accept it and continue applying for jobs. Remember, every rejection is an opportunity to practice your interviewing skills.
