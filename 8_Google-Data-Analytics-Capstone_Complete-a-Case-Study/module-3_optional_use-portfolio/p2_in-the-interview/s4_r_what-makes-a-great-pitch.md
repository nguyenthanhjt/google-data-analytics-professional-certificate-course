There is a certain question that you will probably be asked throughout your career, especially during professional interviews: “Tell me about yourself?” This can be tricky to answer well, but the goal is to positively and accurately represent yourself using your past and present experiences and skills–essentially, you need to pitch yourself. In this reading, you will learn how to promote yourself as an effective and highly skilled data analyst in a job interview. Even if you don’t have any professional data analysis work on your resume yet, experience and skills you gained from previous work of any kind can be useful to share if you pitch it the right way.

## Interview Questions

To help you prepare, here are some possible questions you might be asked in an interview, including technical questions to assess specific practical knowledge and questions that require you to apply your own personal experiences.
