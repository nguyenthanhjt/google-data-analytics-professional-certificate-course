## Video transcript

- Hi Jordan, how are you? Hi, Sally
- Nice to meet you
- Can you hear me? Yes
- Perfectly
- Awesome
- Well, thanks for taking the time to meet with me
- Of course, I'm excited to meet with you, but it's a little nerve-racking
- Well, nothing to be nervous about
- This will just be an opportunity for me to get to know you and for you to understand a little bit more about this junior data analyst role and what it entails
- Why don't we start off, tell me a little bit about yourself
- Sure
- I originally thought I was going to be a teacher, but life had other plans for me and I decided it wasn't what I really wanted to do with my life
- I took some time off and worked in retail for a bit
- Then someone told me about the Google Data Analytics Certificate Program
- I decided to give it a try, something different
- It turns out, I really like the stuff and I was pretty good at it
- I decided to apply for the junior analyst role
- What specifically drew you to data analytics? I really like that is centered around digging into things and learning more about them and improving them
- It's like working with puzzles, but when you finish the puzzle, you're helping companies make smarter business decisions
- I mean, that's pretty cool
- That's awesome
- I love puzzles too
- Speaking of which, not all puzzles have a direct solution and sometimes things can fall apart
- Is there a time when you've dealt with a really difficult issue that you had to take ownership of? Definitely
- When I was a teacher, we frequently had problems, issues with budgeting for things like school supplies and after-school programs
- We always seemed to run out of money because we were working with one budget for everything
- I rallied the other teachers together and we created budgets for each category and that worked a lot better
- I can imagine that was really frustrating
- Sure
- We had to figure it out all ourselves because no one was going to fix it for us
- Since no one was initiating it, I decided to take it on as a side project
- Well, I know you mentioned working with other teachers and in retail in the past
- For this role, there will be times when you're working with other team members and times when you're just by yourself
- Do you have a preference or what is your preferred working style? I have experience working in both situations
- I love working with people and collaborating just like I did for the budgeting project and in retail
- I'm also really good at working independently and getting things done
- After all I was a teacher, so I created my own teaching plans and managed my own classroom
- I just try to keep an open mind and bring people in as needed
- Very good
- Someone like you who is transitioning from a completely different field to being a data analyst, how would you adapt to that change if hired? Well, though they're very different fields, I think a lot of my prior experience would translate well in analytics
- My ability as a teacher to sift through a lot of information and distill it down to what's important and easily understandable
- That would be very beneficial as a data analyst when I'm explaining data and numbers to someone who might not like math
- Working in retail made me really good at communication and managing classrooms and difficult customers both made me really good at people managing too
- I think these skills will translate really well as a data analyst
- Great
- One last question, how do you stay motivated when you're working on a project? Good question
- For me it's the people I work with
- I love getting to know the people I work with because that's what's going to motivate me to put in that extra time and that extra effort
- Because I know my work means something to someone I know
- That's what motivates me and keeps me going
- Excellent
- Well, that's all the questions that I had
- Do you have any questions for me? Yes, I do
- What does a typical work week look like in this role? Good question
- In this role, you would be working mainly with our technology teams and a couple of data scientists
- We do have a stand up meeting every Monday to go over important tasks, align on goals and check everyone's progress
- This company is really about open communication
- You'd be brought in to different meetings and you'll find that you're constantly talking to your colleagues about all manner of things, especially if there's a deadline coming up
- That's good to hear
- Open communication is always important
- Can you tell me a little bit more about the day-to-day? Yes
- For sure
- I think your job would mostly involve analyzing large datasets like administrative data, insurance, billing claims, basically a lot of different information
- It's heavily dependent on the specific project
- Great
- Thank you
- I like that there's variety depending on the project
- One more question
- What's your favorite part about working for this company? Sometimes a difficult question, but I definitely love our team
- I think it's a really smart and dedicated group of people who really love what they do
- We're all very collaborative and respectful of each other, which is especially important when you're dealing with stressful situations or a problem that comes up out of nowhere
- I also really love how comfortable I am communicating with everyone, even stakeholders
- That really makes life so much easier
- That's awesome
- I think it's really important for a work environment to be approachable
- Yes, for sure
- When you realize everyone pretty much wants the same end goal, there's really no reason not to be cooperative and communicative
- I agree
- I know I said that was my last question, but I have one more
- Can I ask what the next steps in this process will look like? Yes, for sure that's where I was going to go next anyways
- Thank you for that question
- We will be contacting candidates within the week and emailing a case study to solve
- We'll set up a second interview for you to present that
- Obviously we'll be looking for how you work, what skills you utilize, and just your technical abilities throughout this assignment
- All of the details will be in the email that I send out, so please keep an eye out for that and I look forward to our next meeting
- Sound good? Perfect
- Thank you so much Jordan and it was really great talking with you and I appreciate you going through the details of the job
- Of course
- Thank you so much for your time, Sally
- It was great getting to know you
- I'll be in touch and I look forward to you speaking soon
- It was a great meeting as well
- Have a great week
- You too
- Bye
