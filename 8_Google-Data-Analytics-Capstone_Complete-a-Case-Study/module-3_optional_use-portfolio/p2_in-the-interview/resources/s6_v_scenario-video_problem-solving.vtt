00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.260
Okay Sally, can you
please tell me about

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.670
a time when you dealt with

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.205
an unexpected challenge at work?

4
00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:11.400
Of course. In retail,

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.280
all sorts of problems can
show up out of nowhere,

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.600
which I'm sure is the case for

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.475
a lot of other
industries as well.

8
00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.280
But there's this one time I
was working in a store as

9
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.690
a sales clerk and then

10
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.560
an extremely unhappy
customer came in.

11
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.055
She was really unhappy about

12
00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:27.630
a recent purchase she made on

13
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.110
an exercise bike and demanded
someone go to her car,

14
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.020
retrieve the bike, and
give her a refund.

15
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.350
I explained that I'd be
happy to provide a refund,

16
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.090
but I wanted to learn
more about what

17
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.325
happened so we could potentially
salvage the situation.

18
00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:44.090
I asked her if there was
something wrong with

19
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.860
the bike and she told me it was

20
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.150
difficult for her to clip

21
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.090
into and out of the bike
with her cycling shoes.

22
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.890
She was upset because

23
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.270
she spent so much
money on a bike that

24
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.560
couldn't do what all exercise
bikes should be able to do.

25
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.255
But upon further examination,

26
00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:02.965
turns out she was wearing
the wrong sized shoes.

27
00:01:02.965 --> 00:01:05.140
Yes, that is the problem.

28
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.340
Absolutely. We got her

29
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.980
a new pair of the right sized
shoes and to double-check

30
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.100
I walked her over to one
of our display bikes,

31
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.005
the same model that
she purchased.

32
00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.290
I had her go on the
bike to try it out.

33
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.160
But she was unable
to click in and

34
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.350
out of the bike as we expected,

35
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.915
and then I noticed the issue.

36
00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:26.300
The clips themselves were
incompatible with the shoes.

37
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.320
This was a manufacturing
issue rather than a user error.

38
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.575
I apologize to the customer.
I informed my manager.

39
00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:35.240
Then called the bike manufacturer

40
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.420
to let them know that
defect right away.

41
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.960
They issued a recall

42
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.180
immediately and asked
for the customer.

43
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.735
I offered her two options.

44
00:01:43.735 --> 00:01:45.725
One, we can take that back

45
00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:48.065
and issue her a
refund immediately.

46
00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:49.480
But the problem with this is,

47
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.915
she would be without a bike,

48
00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:52.795
which is what she
originally wanted.

49
00:01:52.795 --> 00:01:55.460
Number 2, the other option was to

50
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.175
offer her a voucher for
any bike in the store,

51
00:01:58.175 --> 00:02:00.470
as well as a free pair
of cycling shoes that

52
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.295
we ensured would fit
into the bike clips.

53
00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:05.720
After discussing these
possible solutions with

54
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.850
both my manager and the customer,

55
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.420
she chose the second option.

56
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.960
The result was a happy
customer this time

57
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.065
who despite coming into
our store really angry,

58
00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:17.470
left the store
extremely satisfied.

59
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.540
My manager was also
very pleased because

60
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.915
a happy customer is a customer
who is going to return.

61
00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:26.270
Wow, and what went through

62
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.650
your thought process as

63
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.765
you were trying to
solve this problem?

64
00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:33.950
Well, first, I had to assess
what the actual problem was.

65
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.860
Did the customer simply not
like the product or was

66
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.175
there a deeper issue that
had a possible solution?

67
00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:42.860
After I figured out what her
issue was with the shoes,

68
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.255
I had to figure out the why.

69
00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:45.940
Why did her shoes not

70
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.915
fit into something they
were designed to fit?

71
00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:50.000
After that resolved
it was a matter of

72
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.140
coming up with solutions that

73
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.075
would make the customer happy.

74
00:02:53.075 --> 00:02:57.280
Is that typical for how you
usually approach problems?

75
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.435
Yeah. Pretty much,

76
00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:01.775
obviously every problem's
a little different.

77
00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:04.055
So I adjust my
approach accordingly.

78
00:03:04.055 --> 00:03:06.380
Generally, I just
like to use empathy

79
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.550
whenever possible to
understand the context.

80
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.030
Then find the root cause and map

81
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.625
out a couple of solutions
to choose from.

82
00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:18.065
Well, that's really
great work, Sally.

83
00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:20.120
You used both critical thinking

84
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.830
and problem-solving abilities,

85
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.360
which is what you'd need to

86
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.640
constantly succeed
as a data analyst.
