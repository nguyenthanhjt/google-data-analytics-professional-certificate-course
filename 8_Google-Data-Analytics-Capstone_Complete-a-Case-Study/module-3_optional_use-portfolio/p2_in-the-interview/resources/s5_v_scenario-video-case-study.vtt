1
00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.105
All right, well, let's
get right into it.

2
00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:06.210
We sent you a case study
of a hypothetical scenario

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.740
where a school needs to

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.780
improve its communication
with parents,

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.070
and we asked for

6
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.370
basically your top insights
into how this can be solved.

7
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.845
Can you take me through
your thought process?

8
00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:21.060
Sure. I just want to say this
is such a great scenario.

9
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.860
I really enjoyed working with it,

10
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.330
and it's something
I imagine a lot

11
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.845
of schools have to deal with.

12
00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:28.365
This is what I came up with.

13
00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:32.665
Here's the presentation
that I put together,

14
00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:35.190
"Bridging the Communication
Gap between Teachers &

15
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.290
Parents" for Creekside
Middle School.

16
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.630
The background problem was
that there were sporadic

17
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.130
or non-existing communication

18
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.920
between teachers and parents.

19
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.870
The solution that we're trying
to come up with is to help

20
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.085
the middle school design an
app for parents to stay

21
00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.840
updated on school news and

22
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.310
their children's
classes and activities.

23
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.090
But for our analytical
goals, we had two.

24
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.155
The first one is, we need
to look into the why.

25
00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:06.540
Why do we want to create
the app in the first place?

26
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.320
And why are we interested in
keeping parents informed?

27
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.210
We want to quantify
the impacts of

28
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.220
doing that, parental involvement,

29
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.070
on student test scores.

30
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.310
And then we looked into the how.

31
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.830
Once we do decide we're
going to create the app,

32
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.280
what are parents interested in?

33
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.505
What do they want to
learn more about?

34
00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:27.200
If we dig into the why first,

35
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.165
this is what we found.

36
00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:30.890
We found that there
was a downward trend

37
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.330
where students' test
scores have been

38
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.385
falling since 2004
and that's a problem.

39
00:01:36.385 --> 00:01:39.695
The reason is because
parental involvement

40
00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:42.320
also dropped in 2004 despite there

41
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.875
being a 14 percentage
point increase

42
00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:47.720
if there are parents involved

43
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.500
versus when parents
are not involved.

44
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.090
Basically we think the drop in

45
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.470
the student test scores

46
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.150
because it correlates
so well with

47
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.660
parental involvement
that the lack

48
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.130
of parental involvement
is the reason

49
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.995
why test scores are dropping,

50
00:02:02.995 --> 00:02:04.400
and so that's why it's

51
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.260
really important
for us to increase

52
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.695
parental involvement to improve
our student test scores.

53
00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:12.035
That's the why. Next we
want to go into the how.

54
00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:13.580
What are the things that

55
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.165
the parents would
want to know about?

56
00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:20.000
This data comes from a
survey in which we asked

57
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.380
students what kind of activities

58
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.480
that they are involved in,

59
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.310
and most student
activities can be

60
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.755
grouped into the following
three categories:

61
00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:32.950
sports, academics and
extracurricular clubs.

62
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.950
And what's interesting
is if we looked

63
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.950
at the news alerts
that's sent out,

64
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.270
these are the things
that the parents

65
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.115
are notified about currently,

66
00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:45.020
and broke it down
from sixth graders,

67
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.460
seventh graders,
and eighth graders,

68
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.860
we've found that
the seventh graders

69
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.584
received the least attention.

70
00:02:50.584 --> 00:02:53.915
They had the fewest number
of news alerts published.

71
00:02:53.915 --> 00:02:57.590
What that means, these
two data points is that,

72
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.720
number one for the categories,

73
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.375
we should create three tabs
or a way in which we can

74
00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:05.269
easily group activities
into three buckets,

75
00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.435
the academic, sports and
extracurricular activities.

76
00:03:08.435 --> 00:03:10.520
Secondly, because
seventh graders were

77
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.830
the ones who had the least
amount of attention,

78
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.050
we would have the biggest
amount of impact if we

79
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.870
prioritized targeting them
during our test launch.

80
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.385
In summary, based on the
analysis that we did,

81
00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:27.140
the why we want to

82
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.730
create an app in the
first place is because

83
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.200
parental involvement is highly

84
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.100
correlated with
higher test scores.

85
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.405
And the how, how to
best design this app,

86
00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:38.925
when we build this app, we
want to make sure the app has

87
00:03:38.925 --> 00:03:41.420
three categories or three tabs

88
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.145
for each activity category,

89
00:03:43.145 --> 00:03:44.990
and we should prioritize
a version 1

90
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.515
launch for parents
of seventh graders.

91
00:03:47.515 --> 00:03:50.225
Here's what a timeline of
events could look like.

92
00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:52.430
The first two weeks
for analysis and

93
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.115
then we're presenting
the analysis now,

94
00:03:55.115 --> 00:03:58.300
and then good chunk of time
where you can build the app,

95
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.285
and during the testing
and iteration,

96
00:04:00.285 --> 00:04:01.790
this is where we want to focus on

97
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.709
the seventh graders,
get their feedback,

98
00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.825
and then finally we can launch

99
00:04:05.825 --> 00:04:08.900
and open it up to
all other grades.

100
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.040
That's how we can build V1
or version 1 of the app.

101
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.875
But we always want to improve.

102
00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:16.550
Further explorations
or ways in which we

103
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.100
can improve for version
2 of the app is,

104
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.390
we can look at
additional questions

105
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.440
like what is the impact of

106
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.710
having multiple children
involved in the same school?

107
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.685
Does that help improve
test scores even further?

108
00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.080
What's the impact of having

109
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.050
one caretaker involved
versus multiple?

110
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.425
Thank you very much.
That's all I had.

111
00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:40.305
Well, great work Sally.

112
00:04:40.305 --> 00:04:42.530
You've really covered
a lot of ground for

113
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.739
a short amount of time and
based on what you've examined,

114
00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:47.600
you understood the objective

115
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.775
and captured who the client is

116
00:04:49.775 --> 00:04:52.100
and what they want
and used data and

117
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.605
visuals that supported
your hypothesis.

118
00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:56.570
Can you tell me a little
bit more about what you

119
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.895
would recommend as next steps?

120
00:04:58.895 --> 00:05:03.710
For sure. My recommendations
for next steps is twofold.

121
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.090
One, we want to share

122
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.310
these insights with the
person or the team building

123
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.980
the app so that they can build

124
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.360
an app for parents to easily

125
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.890
move between those three tabs,

126
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.485
the three activity
categories, and two,

127
00:05:15.485 --> 00:05:17.765
once we enter the testing
and iteration phase,

128
00:05:17.765 --> 00:05:19.040
we should prioritize building for

129
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.370
seventh graders for
the biggest impact.

130
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.070
Great, well done.

131
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.040
I really appreciate
your time on this.

132
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.800
I'll take a further look
into your presentation and

133
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.010
my notes and I'll reach out
soon with my final thoughts.

134
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.230
Thanks, Jordan. I
look forward to it.
