00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.165
Hi Jordan, how are you?

2
00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:05.250
Hi, Sally. Nice to meet you.

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.080
Can you hear me?

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.550
Yes. Perfectly.

5
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.560
Awesome. Well, thanks for

6
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.165
taking the time to meet with me.

7
00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:15.180
Of course, I'm excited
to meet with you,

8
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.685
but it's a little nerve-racking.

9
00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:19.830
Well, nothing to
be nervous about.

10
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.540
This will just be an
opportunity for me

11
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.460
to get to know you and for you to

12
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.140
understand a little
bit more about

13
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.845
this junior data analyst
role and what it entails.

14
00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:30.570
Why don't we start off, tell

15
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.220
me a little bit about yourself.

16
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.465
Sure. I originally thought I
was going to be a teacher,

17
00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:39.000
but life had other
plans for me and I

18
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.395
decided it wasn't what I

19
00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:42.035
really wanted to do with my life.

20
00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:45.275
I took some time off and
worked in retail for a bit.

21
00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:46.520
Then someone told me about

22
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.495
the Google Data Analytics
Certificate Program.

23
00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:53.940
I decided to give it a
try, something different.

24
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.820
It turns out, I really

25
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.900
like the stuff and I
was pretty good at it.

26
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.475
I decided to apply for
the junior analyst role.

27
00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:04.810
What specifically drew
you to data analytics?

28
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.390
I really like that is
centered around digging

29
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.860
into things and learning more

30
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.765
about them and improving them.

31
00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:14.310
It's like working with puzzles,

32
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.810
but when you finish the puzzle,

33
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.875
you're helping companies make
smarter business decisions.

34
00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:20.645
I mean, that's pretty cool.

35
00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:24.130
That's awesome. I
love puzzles too.

36
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.455
Speaking of which,
not all puzzles have

37
00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:31.390
a direct solution and sometimes
things can fall apart.

38
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.410
Is there a time when
you've dealt with

39
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.150
a really difficult issue

40
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.355
that you had to
take ownership of?

41
00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:40.910
Definitely. When I was a teacher,

42
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.060
we frequently had
problems, issues with

43
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.350
budgeting for things like

44
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.780
school supplies and
after-school programs.

45
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.790
We always seemed to run
out of money because

46
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.240
we were working with one
budget for everything.

47
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.850
I rallied the other teachers
together and we created

48
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.795
budgets for each category
and that worked a lot better.

49
00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:03.040
I can imagine that was
really frustrating.

50
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.480
Sure. We had to figure it out

51
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.660
all ourselves because no one
was going to fix it for us.

52
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.135
Since no one was
initiating it,

53
00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:14.375
I decided to take it
on as a side project.

54
00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:17.330
Well, I know you
mentioned working with

55
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.110
other teachers and in
retail in the past.

56
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.970
For this role,
there will be times

57
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.040
when you're working with
other team members

58
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.945
and times when you're
just by yourself.

59
00:02:26.945 --> 00:02:28.220
Do you have a preference or

60
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.395
what is your preferred
working style?

61
00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:34.470
I have experience working
in both situations.

62
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.580
I love working with people
and collaborating just

63
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.970
like I did for the budgeting
project and in retail.

64
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.610
I'm also really good at working
independently and getting

65
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.160
things done. After
all I was a teacher,

66
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.050
so I created my
own teaching plans

67
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.850
and managed my own classroom.

68
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.530
I just try to keep an open mind

69
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.485
and bring people in as needed.

70
00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:57.155
Very good. Someone like you
who is transitioning from

71
00:02:57.155 --> 00:03:00.560
a completely different field
to being a data analyst,

72
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.440
how would you adapt to
that change if hired?

73
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.550
Well, though they're
very different fields,

74
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.660
I think a lot of

75
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.995
my prior experience would
translate well in analytics.

76
00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:13.760
My ability as a teacher to

77
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.530
sift through a lot
of information and

78
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.970
distill it down to what's

79
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.355
important and easily
understandable.

80
00:03:19.355 --> 00:03:22.400
That would be very beneficial
as a data analyst

81
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.170
when I'm explaining data and

82
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.845
numbers to someone who
might not like math.

83
00:03:26.845 --> 00:03:29.060
Working in retail made me really

84
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.055
good at communication and

85
00:03:31.055 --> 00:03:33.950
managing classrooms
and difficult customers

86
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.830
both made me really good
at people managing too.

87
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.570
I think these skills will

88
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.260
translate really well
as a data analyst.

89
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.314
Great. One last question,

90
00:03:44.314 --> 00:03:45.845
how do you stay motivated

91
00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:48.250
when you're working on a project?

92
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.555
Good question. For me it's
the people I work with.

93
00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:54.110
I love getting to know

94
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.970
the people I work with
because that's what's

95
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.560
going to motivate me to put in

96
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.795
that extra time and
that extra effort.

97
00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:01.550
Because I know my work means

98
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.165
something to someone I know.

99
00:04:04.165 --> 00:04:07.670
That's what motivates
me and keeps me going.

100
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.030
Excellent. Well, that's all
the questions that I had.

101
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.205
Do you have any questions for me?

102
00:04:13.205 --> 00:04:15.605
Yes, I do.

103
00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:20.275
What does a typical work
week look like in this role?

104
00:04:20.275 --> 00:04:23.015
Good question. In this role,

105
00:04:23.015 --> 00:04:24.770
you would be working mainly with

106
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.450
our technology teams and a
couple of data scientists.

107
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.830
We do have a stand
up meeting every

108
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.455
Monday to go over
important tasks,

109
00:04:33.455 --> 00:04:36.545
align on goals and check
everyone's progress.

110
00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:39.740
This company is really
about open communication.

111
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.915
You'd be brought in
to different meetings

112
00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:43.010
and you'll find that you're

113
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.080
constantly talking
to your colleagues

114
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.775
about all manner of things,

115
00:04:46.775 --> 00:04:49.300
especially if there's
a deadline coming up.

116
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.135
That's good to hear.

117
00:04:51.135 --> 00:04:53.630
Open communication
is always important.

118
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.100
Can you tell me a little bit
more about the day-to-day?

119
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.980
Yes. For sure.

120
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.180
I think your job would
mostly involve analyzing

121
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.734
large datasets like
administrative data,

122
00:05:05.734 --> 00:05:06.845
insurance,

123
00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:10.335
billing claims, basically a
lot of different information.

124
00:05:10.335 --> 00:05:13.855
It's heavily dependent
on the specific project.

125
00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:16.130
Great. Thank you. I like that

126
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.920
there's variety depending
on the project.

127
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.975
One more question.

128
00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:24.890
What's your favorite part about
working for this company?

129
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.840
Sometimes a difficult question,

130
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.520
but I definitely love our team.

131
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.640
I think it's a really
smart and dedicated group

132
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.315
of people who really
love what they do.

133
00:05:34.315 --> 00:05:36.320
We're all very collaborative

134
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.850
and respectful of each other,

135
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.840
which is especially important
when you're dealing with

136
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.550
stressful situations or a problem

137
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.200
that comes up out of nowhere.

138
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.990
I also really love
how comfortable I am

139
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.275
communicating with everyone,
even stakeholders.

140
00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:53.825
That really makes
life so much easier.

141
00:05:53.825 --> 00:05:56.360
That's awesome. I think
it's really important

142
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.255
for a work environment
to be approachable.

143
00:05:59.255 --> 00:06:01.205
Yes, for sure.

144
00:06:01.205 --> 00:06:02.810
When you realize everyone pretty

145
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.280
much wants the same end goal,

146
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.600
there's really no reason not to

147
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.595
be cooperative and communicative.

148
00:06:07.595 --> 00:06:11.840
I agree. I know I said
that was my last question,

149
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.265
but I have one more.

150
00:06:13.265 --> 00:06:15.215
Can I ask what the next steps

151
00:06:15.215 --> 00:06:16.900
in this process will look like?

152
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.420
Yes, for sure that's

153
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.950
where I was going
to go next anyways.

154
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.450
Thank you for that question.

155
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.170
We will be contacting
candidates within the week

156
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.245
and emailing a case
study to solve.

157
00:06:27.245 --> 00:06:30.325
We'll set up a second interview
for you to present that.

158
00:06:30.325 --> 00:06:33.065
Obviously we'll be looking
for how you work,

159
00:06:33.065 --> 00:06:34.655
what skills you utilize,

160
00:06:34.655 --> 00:06:36.350
and just your technical abilities

161
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.780
throughout this assignment.

162
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.610
All of the details will be in
the email that I send out,

163
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.305
so please keep an
eye out for that

164
00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:45.215
and I look forward to our
next meeting. Sound good?

165
00:06:45.215 --> 00:06:47.150
Perfect. Thank you so much

166
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.800
Jordan and it was
really great talking

167
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.300
with you and I appreciate you

168
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.405
going through the
details of the job.

169
00:06:52.405 --> 00:06:55.040
Of course. Thank you so
much for your time, Sally.

170
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.710
It was great getting to know you.

171
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.885
I'll be in touch and I look
forward to you speaking soon.

172
00:06:59.885 --> 00:07:02.900
It was a great meeting as
well. Have a great week.

173
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.610
You too. Bye.
