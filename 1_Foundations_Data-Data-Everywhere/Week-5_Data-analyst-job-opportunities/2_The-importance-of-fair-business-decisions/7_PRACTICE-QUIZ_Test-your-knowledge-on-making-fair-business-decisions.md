## 1.What steps do data analysts take to ensure fairness when collecting data? Select all that apply

- Clean the data provided
- Understand the social context
- Include data self-reported by individuals
- Use an inclusive sample population

To ensure fairness when collecting data, data analysts should take the following steps:

Understand the social context: Understanding the broader social and cultural context in which the data is collected is crucial to recognize potential biases and ensure fairness.

Use an inclusive sample population: Ensuring that the sample population used for data collection is diverse and representative helps minimize bias and promotes fairness.

Therefore, the correct options are:

- `Understand the social context`:Considering inclusive sample populations, social context, and self-reported data enable fairness in data collection.
- `Use an inclusive sample population`:Considering inclusive sample populations, social context, and self-reported data enable fairness in data collection.

Cleaning the data provided is a step related to data preprocessing and may not directly address fairness concerns. Including data self-reported by individuals can be a useful approach in some cases but doesn't specifically ensure fairness by itself.

## 2.Avens Engineering needs more engineers, so they purchase ads on a job search website. The website’s data reveals that 86% of engineers are men. Based on that number, an analyst decides that men are more likely to be successful applicants, so they target the ads to male job seekers. What should the analyst have done instead?

- Let Avens Engineering decide which type of applicants to target ads to.
- Only show ads for the engineering jobs to women.
- `Make sure their recommendation doesn’t create or reinforce bias`: They should make sure their recommendation doesn't create or reinforce bias. As a data analyst, it’s important to help create systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone.
- Decline to accept ads from Avens Engineering because of fairness concerns.

The analyst's decision to target ads specifically to male job seekers based solely on the fact that 86% of engineers are men is an example of creating or reinforcing bias. Instead, the analyst should have considered a more inclusive approach that doesn't unfairly favor one gender over the other and aims to attract a diverse pool of applicants. Promoting diversity and inclusion in the hiring process is an essential aspect of fairness and equal opportunity.

## 3.On a railway line, peak ridership occurs between 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM. The fairness of a passenger survey could be improved by over-sampling data from which group?

- Female passengers
- Daytime riders
- Nighttime riders
- Male passengers

To improve the fairness of a passenger survey on a railway line with peak ridership occurring between 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM, you should consider over-sampling data from the group that is underrepresented or less likely to be captured by the survey. In this context, that would likely be:

- `Nighttime riders`: Over-sampling the data from nighttime riders, an under-represented group of passengers, could improve the fairness of the survey.   Review this video on [understanding data and fairness]
.

Over-sampling nighttime riders can help ensure that the survey captures a more representative sample of passengers, including those who might not be well-represented during the peak hours. This approach aims to reduce bias in the survey results and make them more accurate and fair.

## 4. A real estate company needs to hire a human resources assistant. The owner asks a data analyst to help them decide where to advertise the job opening. The analyst learns that the majority of human resources professionals are women, validates this finding with research, and targets ads to a women's community college. This is fair because the analyst conducted research to make sure the information about gender breakdown of human resources professionals was accurate

- True
- `False`

`False`.

While the analyst conducted research to validate the gender breakdown of human resources professionals, targeting job ads exclusively to a women's community college is not necessarily fair. Even if the majority of HR professionals are women, it's important to maintain a fair and inclusive hiring process that doesn't discriminate against any gender. Fair hiring practices should encourage applications from all qualified candidates, regardless of gender. Targeting ads exclusively to one gender or a specific group could potentially be viewed as discriminatory and may not align with fair employment practices.
