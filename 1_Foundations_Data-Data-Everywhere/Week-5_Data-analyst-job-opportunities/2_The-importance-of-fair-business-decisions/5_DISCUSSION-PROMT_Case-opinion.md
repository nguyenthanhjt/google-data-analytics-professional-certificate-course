# Case opinion

- Recently, you were presented with cases about data analytics in the real world. One case involved an unfair conclusion about the performance of women who worked at a business. It demonstrated that data can sometimes be true, yet unfair. In addition, it highlighted the importance of asking, "Why?" when reviewing the results of data analysis.
- Another example involved data analysts prioritizing fairness and going out of their way to ensure their data was as fair as possible. Because they were working with sensitive and potentially biased health data, they chose to collaborate with social scientists in order to better understand the social context behind that data.
- If you need to, return to the video to refresh your understanding of the examples before you continue. Then, discuss the first case and how the analysts at that company could improve their process:
  - What could they have done differently to be fairer in their analysis?
  - What could have made their conclusion less biased?

## My Response

In the first case, where the conclusion about the performance of women at a business seemed unfair, I think there were several steps the analysts could have taken to make their analysis fairer. One key aspect is how they collected and handled the data. They should have been more mindful of potential biases in data collection, perhaps by using a more diverse data source or ensuring that their sample was more representative of the entire workforce. This would have helped reduce gender-related biases in their analysis.

Moreover, I believe they should have taken a broader approach to their analysis. Instead of focusing solely on gender as the determining factor, they could have looked at a range of other factors that could influence performance. Asking "Why?" at every stage of their analysis would have been crucial. By delving into aspects like workplace conditions, access to resources, or career development opportunities, they might have uncovered more nuanced reasons for performance differences, making their conclusion less biased.

To improve their process, collaboration with social scientists or diversity and inclusion experts would have been invaluable. These experts could have helped them better understand the social and cultural factors at play, providing a more holistic view of the situation. This collaborative approach would have helped ensure a fairer analysis and a more accurate interpretation of the data. It's a reminder that data analysis shouldn't happen in a vacuum, and context is vital in reaching fair conclusions.
