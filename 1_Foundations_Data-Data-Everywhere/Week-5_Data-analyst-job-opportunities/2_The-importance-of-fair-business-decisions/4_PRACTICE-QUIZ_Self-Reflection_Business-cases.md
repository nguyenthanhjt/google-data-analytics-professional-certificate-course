# Self-Reflection: Business cases

## Overview

- Now that you have explored how businesses use data in the real world, you can pause for a moment and think about what you are learning. In this self-reflection, you will consider fairness and data use in three example business cases and respond to brief questions with your thoughts.
- This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to apply your knowledge of fairness practices to scenarios that represent real-life business case studies. As you answer questions—and come up with questions of your own—you will consider concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You’ve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

## Case Study #1

To improve the effectiveness of its teaching staff, the administration of a high school offered the opportunity for all teachers to participate in a workshop. They were not required to attend; instead, the administration encouraged teachers to sign up. Of the 43 teachers on staff, 19 chose to take the workshop.
At the end of the academic year, the administration collected data on teacher performance for all teachers on staff. The data was collected via student survey. In the survey, students were asked to rank each teacher's effectiveness on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 6 (very good).
The administration compared data on teachers who attended the workshop to data on teachers who did not. The comparison revealed that teachers who attended the workshop had an average score of 4.95, while teachers who did not attend had an average score of 4.22. The administration concluded that the workshop was a success.

## Case study #2

An automotive company tests the driving capabilities of its self-driving car prototype. They carry out the tests on various types of roadways—specifically, a race track, trail track, and dirt road.
The researchers only test the prototype during the daytime. They collect two types of data: sensor data from the car during the drives and video data of the drives from cameras on the car.
They review the data after the initial tests. The results illustrate that the new self-driving car meets the performance standards across each of the roadways. As a result, the car can progress to the next phase of testing, which will include driving in various weather conditions.

## Case Study #3

An amusement park plans to add new rides to their property. First, they need to determine what kinds of new rides visitors want the park to build. In order to understand their visitors’ interests, the park develops a survey.
They decide to distribute the survey near the roller coasters because the lines are long enough that visitors will have time to answer all of the questions. After collecting this survey data, they find that most of the respondents want more roller coasters at the park. They conclude that they should add more roller coasters, as most of their visitors prefer them.

## Reflection task

Consider this scenario:

- What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?
- How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?
Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.

### Response Case study #1

- Examples of Fair or Unfair Practices:
In this scenario, one fair practice is that the administration offered the workshop on a voluntary basis rather than forcing teachers to attend. However, an unfair practice arises in the comparison of teacher performance based solely on student survey data. Using student survey data as the sole metric for effectiveness can be unfair as it may not account for other factors that impact teaching quality.
- How a Data Analyst Could Correct Unfair Practices:
A data analyst could correct unfair practices by conducting a more comprehensive analysis. This might include controlling for potential confounding variables, such as prior teacher performance, to ensure a fair comparison.
Additionally, the analyst should assess the fairness of the student survey itself. Are there any biases or factors that might influence student responses unfairly? Adjustments to the survey or data collection process could be made to minimize these biases and ensure a more accurate evaluation of teacher performance.

### Response Case study #2

Examples of Fair or Unfair Practices:

- Fair Practice: Testing the self-driving car prototype on different types of roadways to assess its performance is a fair practice, as it provides a diverse range of real-world scenarios.
- Unfair Practice: Limiting the tests to daytime conditions only may be unfair because it doesn't account for nighttime driving scenarios, which are crucial for evaluating the car's safety and performance comprehensively.
How a Data Analyst Could Correct Unfair Practices:
- A data analyst could correct unfair practices by recommending additional testing during nighttime conditions to ensure a more comprehensive assessment of the self-driving car's capabilities.
- They could also analyze the sensor and video data to determine if there are specific scenarios or challenges that were not adequately covered in the initial tests, helping the company identify potential areas for improvement before moving to the next testing phase with various weather conditions.

### Response Case study #3

Examples of Fair or Unfair Practices:

- Fair Practice: Developing a survey to gather visitor preferences for new rides is a fair approach to involve the park's patrons in the decision-making process.
- Unfair Practice: Distributing the survey exclusively near the roller coasters may introduce a bias, as it primarily captures the opinions of visitors who are interested in or have chosen to ride roller coasters. This may not accurately represent the diverse preferences of all park visitors.

How a Data Analyst Could Correct Unfair Practices:

- A data analyst could correct unfair practices by diversifying the survey distribution locations within the park. This could include areas near different types of rides and attractions to ensure a more balanced representation of visitor preferences.
- Additionally, the analyst could stratify the survey results based on demographic information to identify any potential biases in the responses and adjust the findings accordingly. This would provide a more accurate reflection of the entire visitor population's interests.
