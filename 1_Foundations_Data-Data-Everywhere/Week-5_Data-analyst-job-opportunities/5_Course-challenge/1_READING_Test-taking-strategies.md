# Test-taking strategies

As you know, this program asks you to complete graded assessments at the end of each module and course. Assessments can sometimes feel overwhelming, but approaching them with a strategy can make them more manageable. Here is a list of tips you can use to prime yourself for success.

## Before taking an assessment

- Review your notes, the videos, the readings, and the most recent glossary to refresh yourself on the content.
- Find a picture of something or an object that makes you feel happy. For example, you might look at a photograph of a beautiful beach or a peaceful forest when you feel overwhelmed.

## During the assessment

- Review the test before filling in answers. Remember to check your work before you click submit.
- Take your time. You are given a full five minutes per question on all graded assessments.
- Answer the easy questions first; skip the ones you don’t know the answer to right away.
- For multiple choice questions, focus on eliminating the wrong answers first.
- Read each question twice. There are often clues that are easy to miss the first time.
- Remember to slow down and trust your knowledge. You probably know more than you give yourself credit for.
- Take a deep breath and give yourself positive feedback.
- Take some time during the assessment to rest for a few seconds, stretch, and shake out your hands. This can really help calm your nerves.

## If you start to feel anxious

- Spell your name backwards or do an easy math problem. This brings you back to the frontal lobe of your brain, which helps you recall information more easily.
- Focus on calm, steady breathing.
- Visualize success.

## Before you submit the assessment

- Check your work, but be confident. Sometimes people change correct answers because they feel wrong, but they’re actually right. Your first instinct is usually correct.
