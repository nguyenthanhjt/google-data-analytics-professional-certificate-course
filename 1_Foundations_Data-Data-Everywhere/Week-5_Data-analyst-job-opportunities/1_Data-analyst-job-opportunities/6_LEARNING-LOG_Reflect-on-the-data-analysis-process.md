# Learning Log: Reflect on the data analysis process

## Overview

- By now, you have started getting familiar with the data analysis process.
- Now, you’ll complete an entry in your learning log reflecting on your experience with the data analysis process and your progress in this course.
- By the time you complete this activity, you will have a stronger understanding of how to use the steps of this process to organize data analysis tasks and solve big problems with data.
- This framework will continue to help guide you through your own work in this course--and as a junior data analyst!

## The data analysis process so far

- Take a moment to appreciate all the work you have done in this course. You identified a question to answer, and systematically worked your way through the data analysis process to answer that question—just like professional data analysts do every day!
- In reviewing the data analysis process so far, you have already performed a lot of these steps. Here are some examples to think about before you begin writing your learning log entry:
  - You asked an interesting question and defined a problem to solve through data analysis to answer that question.
  - You thought deeply about what data you would need and how you would collect it in order to prepare for analysis.
  - You processed your data by organizing and structuring it in a table and then moving it to a spreadsheet.
  - You analyzed your data by inspecting and scanning it for patterns.
  - You shared your first data visualization: a bar chart.
  - Finally, after completing all the other steps, you acted: You reflected on your results, made decisions, and gained insight into your problem--even if that insight was that you didn't have enough data, or that there were no obvious patterns in your data.

As you progress through the rest of the program, you will continue using and revisiting these steps to help guide you through your own analysis tasks. You will also learn more about different tools that can help you along the way!

## Reflection

- In your learning log, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) reflecting on the data analysis process and your experiences so far by answering each of the questions below:
  - Which part(s) of the data analysis process did you enjoy the most? What did you enjoy about it?
  - What were some of the key ideas you learned in this course?
  - Are there concepts or portions of the content that you would like to learn more about? If so, what are they? Which upcoming course do you think would teach you the most about this area?
  - Now that you’ve gained experience doing data analysis, how do you feel about becoming a data analyst? Have your feelings changed since you began this course? If so, how?

When you’ve finished your entry in the learning log template, make sure to save the document so your response is somewhere accessible. This will help you continue applying data analysis to your everyday life. You will also be able to track your progress and growth as a data analyst.

### My Response

● Which part(s) of the data analysis process did you enjoy the most? What did you enjoy about it? 
In the data analysis processes, the parts I like most are 'Process' and 'Analyze'. Because I have learned about what/which steps we need to implement to make raw data can be used, I found the "Processing" phase the most enjoyable. It's like solving a puzzle and transforming raw data into meaningful insights.
● What were some of the key ideas you learned in this course?
After some lectures in this course, I think that data can help us resolve and answer a lot of questions and problems in real life.
I learned that data is a powerful tool for problem-solving and that precise questions can uncover root causes.
I am passionate about defining the questions to find out the root cause of the problems,...
● Are there concepts or portions of the content that you would like to learn more about? If so, what are they? Which upcoming course do you think would teach you the most about this area?
The things that I think we need to improve and enhance in this course are the practices, stuff that get our hands dirty, and understanding knowledge that we acquired in each lesson,...
I'd like more hands-on practice, especially in data visualization and advanced statistics. An advanced data analytics or machine learning course would be ideal.
● Now that you’ve gained experience doing data analysis, how do you feel about becoming a data analyst? Have your feelings changed since you began this course? If so, how?
I am really excited to have an opportunity to become a data analyst, to comprehend all the things that we can retrieve from data, and to apply all the insight we obtain from data to make our lives and our world better.
My perspective has shifted, and I now see it as a dynamic field with vast potential to make a positive impact.
My feeling has changed a lot, my view changed from an aspect of a Software Engineer to an aspect of data, It's so different and larger,...
