## How a business uses data

- In this self-reflection, you’ll consider the businesses you interact with day-to-day and reflect on how they use data to improve their customer experience.

- Pick a company, service, or product that you've had personal experience with that uses data to improve its customer service. Some examples are local restaurants, health care providers, internet providers, or your favorite smartphone app.
- Then, think of a specific customer experience problem this company, service or product might have that you suspect could be addressed with data. This could be something like a restaurant tracking sales of a new product, or internet service providers trying to figure out where outages occur.
- Try to avoid broad problems and think of specific issues. A good example of a problem would be that the meal you ordered from a delivery service arrived cold.

## Reflection

- Consider the company, service, or product you chose in this reflection:
  - How could it use data to improve customer experience?
  - What kinds of data would it need to collect?
  - How could insights from that data solve a problem?
