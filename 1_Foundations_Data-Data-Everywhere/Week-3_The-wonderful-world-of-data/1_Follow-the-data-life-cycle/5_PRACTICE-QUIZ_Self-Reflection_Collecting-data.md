3 materials to review

## 1.Overview

- Now that you are familiar with the phases of the data life cycle, you can take a moment to think about your learning. In this self-reflection, you will consider your thoughts about collecting data and how data collection fits into the data life cycle.
- To start, you will consider a simple scenario: discussing the data life cycle in a mock interview for a data analyst role. Then, you will respond to three brief questions. You’ve done the hard work to learn the basics of the data life cycle, so get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

### The scenario: interview for a data analyst position

- Imagine that you interview for a data analyst role at a local ice cream company.The hiring manager explains that the company needs a data analyst because they want to learn more about their customers. First, they want to understand their customers’ ice cream flavor preferences. Then, they will use this customer data to help make important decisions.
- The hiring manager explains that they do not collect any customer data, and they don’t know where to begin. The hiring manager asks you: Can you please explain how you would approach this task?
- Before responding to the question, you consider each step of the data life cycle.

- **Recap: The data life cycle**
  - The steps of the data life cycle are:
    - Plan: What plans and decisions do you need to make? What data do you need to answer your question?
    - Capture: Where does your data come from? How will you get it?
    - Manage: How will you store your data? What should it be used for? How do you keep this data secure and - protected?
    - Analyze: How will the company analyze the data? What tools should they use?
    - Archive: What should they do with their data when it gets old? How do they know when it's time?
    - Destroy: Should they ever dispose of any data? If so, when and how?
- **Reflection**

- Consider your learning about the steps of the data life cycle and reflect on the hiring manager’s request. Review the following questions to help guide your thinking:
  - What kind of data should they gather?
  - How should they gather this data?
  - Where will the data live? How will they store the data?
  - Once they have the data, how will they use it?
  - How do they keep their data secure and protected?
  - What should they do with old data? What are their options?
- In the text box below, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) that explains your recommendation for how the ice cream company should collect customer flavor preference data.

Answer 1:
To collect customer flavor preference data, the ice cream company can implement a few strategies. Firstly, they can introduce a customer feedback system, such as surveys or comment cards, in their physical stores and on their website. Secondly, they can incentivize customers to provide feedback by offering discounts or rewards. Lastly, they can leverage their existing point-of-sale system to track purchase patterns and identify popular flavors. These methods will enable the company to gather valuable data directly from customers, helping them understand their preferences and make informed decisions.

- Correct
Great work reinforcing your learning with a meaningful self-reflection! A good reflection on this topic would address that—to use their data successfully—the ice cream company must:
  - Figure out what data they need and where they can get it.
  - Collect the data, and be sure of what they will (and won’t) use it for.
  - Consider how to secure the data and deal with old data that is no longer useful.
- As a data analyst, these are the types of questions you should always seek to answer about your data. From considering data collection before a project begins (in the plan phase) to removing data with data erasure software (in the destroy phase), data analysts must apply these concepts to effectively approach each data project.

Answer 2:
To gather customer flavor preference data, the ice cream company should collect the following types of data: customer demographics (age, gender, location), flavor ratings or rankings, purchase history, and feedback/comments. They can gather this data through various channels such as customer surveys, online feedback forms, loyalty programs, and point-of-sale systems.

The collected data should be stored in a secure and centralized database, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. The company can employ cloud-based solutions or maintain an in-house server infrastructure with appropriate security measures like access controls and encryption to protect the data.

Once they have the data, the ice cream company can analyze it to identify popular flavors, customer preferences based on demographics, and trends over time. This analysis can guide their decision-making process regarding flavor offerings, marketing campaigns, and product development strategies.

To keep the data secure and protected, the company should regularly monitor and update their security measures, conduct vulnerability assessments, and provide employee training on data handling and privacy. They should adhere to data protection regulations, implement data backup protocols, and have a response plan in place in case of a data breach.

Regarding old data, the ice cream company has several options. They can archive the data for future analysis and reference, especially for historical trends and long-term customer behavior studies. They should define a data retention policy that aligns with legal requirements and business needs. If the data becomes obsolete or no longer serves any purpose, they should consider securely disposing of it in compliance with data protection regulations.
