# Self-Reflection: Reviewing past concepts

## Overview

- Now that you have been introduced to working with data, you can pause for a moment and think about what you are learning. In this self-reflection, you will consider your thoughts about the data analysis process and data life cycle, then respond to brief questions.

- This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to apply your knowledge of the phases of data analysis to your data analysis toolbox. As you answer questions—and come up with questions of your own—you will consider concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You’ve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

## Review the phases of data

So far you’ve learned about the data analysis process and the data life cycle. They include the following steps:

- Data Analysis Process:
  - Ask
  - Prepare
  - Process
  - Analyze
  - Share
  - Act

- Data Life Cycle:
  - Plan
  - Capture
  - Manage
  - Analyze
  - Archive
  - Destroy

For a refresher on the phases of data, you can review the [reading on the data analysis process](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/supplement/Yo3Cn/the-data-analysis-process-and-this-program) and [the video on the data life cycle](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/mhEHY/phases-of-the-data-life-cycle).

## Reflection

- Consider what you reviewed about the phases of data:
  - What is the relationship between the data life cycle and the data analysis process? How are the two processes similar? How are they different?
  - What is the relationship between the Ask phase of the data analysis process and the Plan phase of the data life cycle? How are they similar? How are they different?
- Reflect on your learning and think about how you can apply the phases of data to future projects.
- Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.

The data life cycle and the data analysis process are closely related. They both involve phases such as planning, analyzing, and sharing, although the data analysis process focuses specifically on extracting insights from data while the data life cycle encompasses the broader management of data from creation to disposal.

The Ask phase of the data analysis process and the Plan phase of the data life cycle are similar in that they both involve setting objectives and defining requirements. However, the Ask phase is more focused on formulating specific questions or hypotheses for the analysis, while the Plan phase is concerned with broader planning and strategy for managing data throughout its life cycle.

Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! A good reflection on this topic would consider the phases that data goes through in its life cycle and how this impacts the data analysis process.

While the data analysis process will drive your projects and help you reach your business goals, you must understand the life cycle of your data in order to use that process. To analyze your data well, you need to have a thorough understanding of it. Similarly, you can collect all the data you want, but the data is only useful to you if you have a plan for analyzing it.

The Plan and Ask phases both involve planning and asking questions, but they tackle different subjects. The Ask phase in the data analysis process focuses on big-picture strategic thinking about business goals. However, the Plan phase focuses on the fundamentals of the project, such as what data you have access to, what data you need, and where you’re going to get it.
