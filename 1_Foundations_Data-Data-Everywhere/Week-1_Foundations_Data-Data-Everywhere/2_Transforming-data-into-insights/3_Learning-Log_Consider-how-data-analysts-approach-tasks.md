# Learning Log: Consider how data analysts approach tasks

## Overview

Earlier you learned about how data analysts at one organization used data to improve employee retention. Now, you’ll complete an entry in your learning log to track your thinking and reflections about those data analysts' process and how they approached this problem. By the time you complete this activity, you will have a stronger understanding of how the six phases of the data analysis process can be used to break down tasks and tackle big questions. This will help you apply these steps to future analysis tasks and start tackling big questions yourself.

## Review the six phases of data analysis

Before you write your entry in your learning log, reflect on the case study from earlier. The data analysts wanted to use data to improve employee retention. In order to do that, they had to break this larger project into manageable tasks. The analysts organized those tasks and activities around the six phases of the data analysis process:

1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act

- The analysts **asked** questions to define both the issue to be solved and what would equal a successful result.
- Next, they **prepared** by building a timeline and collecting data with employee surveys that were designed to be inclusive.
- They **processed** the data by cleaning it to make sure it was complete, correct, relevant, and free of errors and outliers.
- They **analyzed** the clean employee survey data. Then the analysts **shared** their findings and recommendations with team leaders. Afterward, leadership **acted** on the results and focused on improving key areas.

## Reflection

In your learning log template, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) reflecting on what you’ve learned from the case study by answering each of the questions below:

- Did the details of the case study help to change the way you think about data - analysis? Why or why not?
- Did you find anything surprising about the way the data analysts approached their - task?
- What else would you like to learn about data analysis?

When you’ve finished your entry in the learning log template, make sure to save the document so your response is somewhere accessible. This will help you continue applying data analysis to your everyday life. You will also be able to track your progress and growth as a data analyst.
