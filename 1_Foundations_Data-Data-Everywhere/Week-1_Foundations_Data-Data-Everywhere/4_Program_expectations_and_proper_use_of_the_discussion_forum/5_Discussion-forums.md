# Discussion Forums

## Overview

- Working well with your classmates is an important part of an online course. At the beginning of this course, take some time to "break the ice" and get to know each other using the discussion forums and prompts. Discussion prompts are course items that have associated threads in the discussion forums. When you answer a discussion prompt, your response goes to the associated forum, along with the responses of your peers.

- Establishing personal interaction with other learners will make your online learning experience much more enjoyable and engaging. We encourage you to use the forums to deepen your learning and peer relationships.

## Meet and greet

- How should you begin? Tell everyone a bit about yourself! Then, read some of your classmates' postings. Pick at least two postings that are the most interesting to you and add a friendly or encouraging response back.

- You can go to the [discussion forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/discussions/weeks/1) and click the New Thread button to begin a new thread.
- You can also go to the [Meet and Greet discussion prompt](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/discussionPrompt/5a0P9/meet-and-greet) to add your introduction story there.

## Updating your profile

- Additionally, consider updating your profile, which can be accessed by clicking the Profile link. This link appears in the menu when you click on your name at the top-right corner of this screen. When classmates find you in the discussion forums, they can click on your name to view your complete profile and get to know you more.

## Upvoting posts

- When you enter the discussion forum for your course, you will find an Upvote button under each post. We encourage you to upvote posts that you find thoughtful, interesting, or helpful. This is the best way to ensure that quality posts will be read by other learners in the course. Upvoting will also increase the likelihood that important questions get addressed and answered.

## Reporting abuse

- Coursera's Code of Conduct prohibits:
  - Bullying or threatening other users
  - Posting spam or promotional content
  - Posting mature content
  - Posting assignment solutions (or other violations of the Honor Code)

- Please report any posts that infringe upon copyright, are abusive, offensive, or that otherwise violate Coursera's Honor Code. You can report posts by using the Report This option found under the menu arrow to the right of each post.

## Following

- If you find a particular thread interesting, click the follow button under the original post of that thread page. When you follow a post, you will receive an email notification any time a new post is made.

## Improving your posts

- Course discussion forums are your chance to interact with thousands of like-minded individuals around the world. In any social interaction, certain rules of etiquette are expected and contribute to more enjoyable and productive communication.
- Stay on topic in existing forums and threads. Off-topic posts make it hard for other learners to find information they need. Post in the most appropriate forum for your topic, and don’t post the same thing in multiple forums.
  - Use the filters at the top of the forum page (Latest, Top, and Unanswered) to find active, - interesting content.
  - Upvote posts that you find helpful and interesting.
  - Be civil. If you disagree, explain your position with respect and refrain from any and all - personal attacks.
  - Make sure you are understood. To be helpful to learners using English as a second language, - try to write full sentences, and avoid text-message abbreviations or slang. Be careful when - you use humor and sarcasm, as these messages are easy to misinterpret.
  - If you are asking a question, provide as much information as possible before or after posing - your question. For example,  you might write what you’ve already considered, what you’ve - already read, etc.
  - Cite appropriate references when using someone else’s ideas, thoughts, or words.
  - Don’t use a forum to promote your product, service, or business.
  - Invite other learners to extend the discussion with an open-ended statement or question. For - example, you might write something like, “I would love to understand what others think.”
  - Don’t post personal information about other posters or yourself in the forum.
  - Report spam and spammers.
