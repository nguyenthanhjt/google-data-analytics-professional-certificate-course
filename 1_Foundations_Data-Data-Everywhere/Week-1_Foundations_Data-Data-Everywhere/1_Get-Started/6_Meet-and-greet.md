Hi there!
I am from VietNam, I currently live in Ha Noi city.
I know Google Data Analytics Certificate the program “Phát triển Nhân tài số: Cơ hội được học, được thành công” which was host by Google Team, TopCV & NIC from VietNam.
I expect to obtain things that help to retrieve benefits from data in real life, make business decisions, and improve workflow...
I'm interested in how data analytics helps people to choose their best solutions in business workflow.
Currently, I have worked as a Software&Data Engineer for several years ago after graduated Bachelor's Degree in the IT field.
First I am basically a Software Engineer, after that, I decided to try a new role - A data engineer. I was so surprised about the BigData approach and solutions at that time, the output of them helps people in my country avoid fault, and improve their life standard.
 My plan is always to learn, research, and make myself better. Day by day, I learn as a curious boy.
Very nice to meet you all, hope this course can help many & more people to make the world better.
