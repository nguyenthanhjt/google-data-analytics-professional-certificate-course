00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.435
What do companies in e-commerce,

2
00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:06.840
entertainment, healthcare,
manufacturing,

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.810
marketing, finance, tech,

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.155
and hundreds of other
industries all have in common?

5
00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:16.440
You guessed it,
they all use data.

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.500
Organizations of all kinds need

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.680
data analysts to help them
improve their processes,

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.095
identify opportunities
and trends,

9
00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:29.040
launch new products, provide
great customer service,

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.855
and make thoughtful decisions.

11
00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:33.480
Hi, I'm Tony, a program manager

12
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.330
at Google and a data
analyst myself.

13
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.800
I like to welcome you to

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.005
the Google Data
Analytics Certificate.

15
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:41.820
Now, there are lots of

16
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.155
great reasons to
earn this certificate.

17
00:00:44.155 --> 00:00:45.990
Maybe you're thinking
about starting

18
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.915
a career in the exciting
world of data analytics,

19
00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:50.880
or maybe you're just fascinated

20
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.325
by the power of data as I am.

21
00:00:53.325 --> 00:00:55.425
No matter what brought you here,

22
00:00:55.425 --> 00:00:58.290
you're in the right place
to kick-start a career and

23
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.270
learn industry-relevant
skills in data analytics.

24
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.780
But first, what exactly is data?

25
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.410
Well, I'll like to say that data

26
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.985
is a collection of facts.

27
00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:12.225
This collection can
include numbers, pictures,

28
00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:16.425
videos, words, measurements,
observations, and more.

29
00:01:16.425 --> 00:01:18.810
Once you have data, analytics

30
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.030
puts it to work through analysis.

31
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.155
Data analysis is the
collection, transformation,

32
00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:29.160
and organization of data in
order to draw conclusions,

33
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.625
make predictions, and drive
informed decision-making.

34
00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.485
And it doesn't stop there.

35
00:01:34.485 --> 00:01:37.110
Data evolves over time which

36
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.540
means this analysis or analytics,

37
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.190
as we call it, can give us

38
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.315
new information throughout
data's entire life cycle.

39
00:01:45.315 --> 00:01:47.025
Data is everywhere.

40
00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:49.740
You use and create data everyday.

41
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.215
Have you ever read
reviews of a product

42
00:01:52.215 --> 00:01:54.765
before deciding whether
or not to buy it?

43
00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:56.865
That's data analysis.

44
00:01:56.865 --> 00:01:59.640
Or maybe you wear a
fitness tracker to count

45
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.640
your steps so you can stay
active throughout the day.

46
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.365
That's data analysis.

47
00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:06.390
But you don't just use data.

48
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.480
You also create huge amounts
of it every single day.

49
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.160
Any time you use your phone,

50
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.365
look up something
online, stream music,

51
00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:17.970
shop with a credit card,

52
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.370
post on social media or use

53
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.685
GPS to map a route,
you're creating data.

54
00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:25.410
Our digital world and

55
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.420
the millions of smart
devices inside of

56
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.130
it have made the amount of data

57
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.975
available truly mind-blowing.

58
00:02:31.975 --> 00:02:34.430
Here at Google we
process more than

59
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.670
40,000 searches every second.

60
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.550
That's 3.5 billion searches a day

61
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.035
and 1.2 trillion
searches every year.

62
00:02:44.035 --> 00:02:46.560
Here's another way
to think about it.

63
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.800
YouTube has almost
two billion users.

64
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.620
If YouTube users
made up a country,

65
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.500
it would be the
largest in the world.

66
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.940
All of that data is transforming
the world around us.

67
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.960
The publication The
Economist recently

68
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.620
called data the world's
most valuable resource.

69
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.240
It's easy to see why

70
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.735
data analysts are so valued
by their organizations.

71
00:03:09.735 --> 00:03:12.770
What exactly does
a data analyst do?

72
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.635
Put simply, a data analyst
is someone who collects,

73
00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:19.365
transforms, and organizes data

74
00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.990
in order to help make
informed decisions.

75
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.760
Besides the role itself,

76
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.740
one of the most
exciting parts of being

77
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.160
a data analyst is the number
of opportunities available.

78
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.400
The demand for data
analysts is greater than

79
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.810
the number of qualified people

80
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.400
to fill these job openings.

81
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.770
This certificate program is

82
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.360
a great first step in

83
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.330
your journey to finding
a job you love.

84
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.710
Data analysts come from

85
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.480
many different
backgrounds and have

86
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.820
all kinds of life experiences.

87
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.475
You don't need decades
of work experience

88
00:03:50.475 --> 00:03:53.520
or an expensive education
to get started.

89
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.100
Many data analysts
taught themselves

90
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.070
the skills they needed
to land their first job,

91
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.690
just like you're doing right now.

92
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.865
Now let's talk more about
what you're going to learn.

93
00:04:05.865 --> 00:04:09.150
The Google Data Analytics
Certificate is split into

94
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.375
courses based on different
processes for data analysis.

95
00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:16.275
Those are ask, prepare,

96
00:04:16.275 --> 00:04:20.820
process, analyze, share, and act.

97
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.730
Plan to watch these
videos in order.

98
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.280
Each one covers a new topic and

99
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.100
every topic builds on what
you've learned before,

100
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.980
making it easy to
track your progress.

101
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.245
You're in the driver's seat.

102
00:04:34.245 --> 00:04:38.640
Even though you might see
things organized by weeks,

103
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.340
everything can be completed
at your own pace.

104
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.850
So you decide how much
you want to do each day.

105
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.545
By the end of the program,

106
00:04:46.545 --> 00:04:49.500
you'll take everything you've
learned and turn it into

107
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.490
a project that you can use
to show off your skills,

108
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.040
and wow hiring managers
at your job interviews.

109
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.280
Now along the way you'll
also hear from Googlers.

110
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.225
That's what we call people
who work here at Google.

111
00:05:02.225 --> 00:05:04.235
They'll give you an inside look

112
00:05:04.235 --> 00:05:06.080
at what it's like to work in

113
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.550
our industry and share

114
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.430
personal stories of how
they got into the field.

115
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.860
They'll also give you
some excellent tips

116
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.935
on how to land your dream job.

117
00:05:14.935 --> 00:05:17.450
Stay tuned. Some
of them are going

118
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.375
to introduce themselves
in just a sec.

119
00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:23.220
I'm Angie. I'm a program manager

120
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.685
of engineering at Google.

121
00:05:24.685 --> 00:05:26.420
I truly believe that cleaning

122
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.715
data is the heart
and soul of data.

123
00:05:28.715 --> 00:05:30.360
It's how you get
to know your data,

124
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.050
its quirks, its
flaws, its mysteries.

125
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.610
I love a good mystery.

126
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.485
It felt like a superpower almost.

127
00:05:36.485 --> 00:05:37.970
I was a detective and I had gone

128
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.850
in there and I'd really
solved something.

129
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.295
Hi, I'm Alex.

130
00:05:41.295 --> 00:05:43.310
I'm a research
scientist at Google.

131
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.180
I research the
different impacts of

132
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.305
artificial intelligence
on society and our users.

133
00:05:52.305 --> 00:05:54.000
My name is Lilah Jones.

134
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.360
I'm a part of our cloud team.

135
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.640
I get a chance to lead a team of

136
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.500
amazing individuals that are

137
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.875
focused on helping
customers get to the cloud.

138
00:06:02.875 --> 00:06:04.215
Hi, I'm Evan.

139
00:06:04.215 --> 00:06:06.600
I'm a learning portfolio
manager here at Google.

140
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.770
I have one of the coolest jobs

141
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.760
in the world where I get to

142
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.800
look at all the different
technologies that affect

143
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.810
big data and then work them into

144
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.080
training courses like this
one for students to take.

145
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.110
I'll be your instructor
for the first course.

146
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.630
I'll take you through
each module that will

147
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.360
cover a specific topic
in a few different ways.

148
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.900
You'll have videos, reading
materials, quizzes,

149
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.110
hands-on activities, and
discussion prompts for

150
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.740
you to chat about with other
students in an online forum.

151
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.980
I'm really excited to be guiding
you through this course,

152
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.675
but I'm especially excited

153
00:06:39.675 --> 00:06:41.805
that you've chosen
this adventure.

154
00:06:41.805 --> 00:06:43.800
Lifelong learning is something

155
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.645
that I'm very passionate about.

156
00:06:45.645 --> 00:06:47.910
Growing up, when I looked around,

157
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.590
I often didn't see many
options available to me.

158
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.530
It wasn't until I started getting

159
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.420
serious about my education that

160
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.710
I realized I had

161
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.975
the control to make
my own opportunities

162
00:06:57.975 --> 00:07:01.945
with education being the key
that would open those doors.

163
00:07:01.945 --> 00:07:04.860
The more I learned and
the harder I worked,

164
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.945
the more possibilities opened up.

165
00:07:06.945 --> 00:07:08.610
Had I not gone after

166
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.415
that knowledge and continued
challenging myself,

167
00:07:11.415 --> 00:07:13.515
I may not be where I am today.

168
00:07:13.515 --> 00:07:17.820
Learning allowed me to grow
personally, be successful,

169
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.490
visit places I would
never have seen,

170
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.035
and meet people I would
never have known.

171
00:07:23.035 --> 00:07:26.790
Now I'm going to introduce
some of those great people.

172
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.880
Hello, I'm Ximena,
financial analyst.

173
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.500
I'll be helping you learn how to

174
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.345
ask the right
questions about data,

175
00:07:33.345 --> 00:07:35.100
the project you work on and

176
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.125
the problems you're
trying to solve.

177
00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:39.780
Hey, my name is Hallie,
analytical lead.

178
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.030
I'm so excited to show you how to

179

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.340
correct, and relevant to

draw conclusions, and
make great decisions.
