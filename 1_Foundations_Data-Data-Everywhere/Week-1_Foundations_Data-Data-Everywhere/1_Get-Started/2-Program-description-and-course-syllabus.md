- What to expect: each week of the course includes a series of lessons with many types of learning opportunities. These include:
  - Videos for instructors to teach new concepts and demonstrate the use of tools
  - Readings to introduce new ideas and build on the concepts from the videos
  - Discussion forums to share, explore, and reinforce lesson topics for better understanding
  - Discussion prompts to promote thinking and engagement in the discussion forums
  - Practice quizzes to prepare you for graded quizzes
  - Graded quizzes to measure your progress and give you valuable feedback
  - Also, be sure to pay attention to the in-video questions that will pop up from time to time. They are designed for you to check your learning.

  - Everyone learns differently, so this program has been designed to let you work at your own pace. Although your personalized deadlines start when you enroll, they are just a guide. Feel free to move through the program at the speed that works best for you. There is no penalty for late assignments; to earn your certificate, all you have to do is complete all of the work. If you prefer, you can extend your deadlines by returning to Overview in the navigation panel and clicking Switch Sessions. Assessments are based on the approach taken by the course to offer a wide variety of learning materials and activities that reinforce important skills. Graded and ungraded quizzes will help the content sink in. Ungraded practice quizzes are a chance for you to prepare for the graded quizzes. Both types of quizzes can be taken more than one time.

- Optional speed track for those experienced in data analytics
The Google Data Analytics Certificate provides instruction and feedback for learners hoping to earn a position as an entry-level data analyst. While many learners will be brand new to the world of data analytics, others may be familiar with the field and simply wanting to brush up on certain skills.

If you believe this course will be primarily a refresher for you, we recommend taking the practice diagnostic quiz (you can find it in this week's content). It will enable you to determine if you should follow the speed track, which is an opportunity to proceed to Course 2 after having taken each of the Course 1 Weekly Challenges and the overall Course Challenge. Learners who score 100% on the diagnostic quiz can treat Course 1 videos, readings, and activities as optional. Learners following the speed track are still able to earn the certificate.

- Tips
- It is strongly recommended to take these courses—and go through the items in each lesson—in the order they appear because new information and concepts build on previous knowledge.
- Use the additional resources that are linked throughout the program. They are designed to support your learning.
- When you encounter useful links in the course, remember to bookmark them so you can refer to the information for study or review.
- Additional resources are free, but some sites place limits on how many articles can be accessed for free each month. Sometimes you can register on the site for full access, but you can always bookmark a resource and come back to view it later.
- If something is confusing, don’t hesitate to re-watch a video, go through a reading again, and so on.
- Take part in all learning opportunities to gain as much knowledge and experience possible.

Congratulations on choosing to take this first step toward becoming part of the wonderful world of data analytics. Enjoy the journey!
