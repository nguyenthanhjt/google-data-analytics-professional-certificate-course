# Helpful resources to get started

- The Google Data Analytics Certificate is designed to provide you with new lessons every week. As you’ve learned, each one includes a series of videos, readings, peer discussions, in-video questions, practice quizzes, and graded quizzes. In this reading, you’ll learn about providing feedback on course content, obtaining the Google Data Analytics Certificate, and helpful habits for successfully completing the certificate.

- Providing feedback or getting help on course content
- Please remember to give feedback on videos, readings, and materials. Just open the resource, and look for the thumbs-up and thumbs-down symbols.
  - Click thumbs-up for materials that are helpful.
  - Click thumbs-down for materials that are not helpful.

- That feedback goes to the course developers, not other learners, and helps improve this course.

- Obtaining the Google Data Analytics Certificate
  - After you complete all eight courses, you qualify for the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

- To receive your certificate, you must:
  - Pass all required assignments in the course or meet the course-passing threshold. Each graded assignment is part of a cumulative graded score, and the passing grade for the Google Data Analytics Certificate is 80%.
    - AND
  - Pay the course certificate fee, or apply and be approved for Coursera Financial Aid.

- You can review videos, readings, discussion forums, in-video questions, and practice quizzes in the program for free. However, you won’t have access to graded assignments. If you choose to go ahead and earn your certificate, you’ll need to upgrade to the certificate program, unlock the graded assessments, and finish those steps.

- Helpful habits for successfully completing the certificate

- As a learner, you’re bringing all of your past experiences and best learning practices to this program. The designers of this course have also put together a list of helpful habits that they believe will help you to be the most successful:
  - Plan your time: Setting regular study times and sticking with them each week can help you make learning a part of your routine. Use a calendar or timetable to create a schedule. Listing what you plan to do each day will break your work down into achievable goals. And creating a quiet place to watch the videos, review the readings, and complete the activities is important, so you can really focus on the material.
  - Learn in order: We recommend taking these courses — and the items in each lesson — in the order they appear, as new information and concepts build on previous ones. By following the order, you’ll be able to get comfortable with ideas, then practice and build on them.
  - Be curious: If you find an idea that gets you excited, please act on it! Ask questions, search for more details online, check out the links that interest you, and take notes on your discoveries. The little things you do to support your learning along the way will take your knowledge even further; open more doors in this new, high-growth field; and help you qualify for all kinds of new jobs.
  - Take notes: Notes are useful when researching something you’re curious about. This is especially helpful when a task seems important and you think it might be useful later. Or, sometimes you might come across a subject that you want to explore in more detail. Keeping notes can help you keep track of what you learn. Finally, taking notes is an effective way to help make connections between topics and gain a better understanding of them. You can use your notes to build your very own data analytics journal — a place where you can capture ideas, information, and any questions you might have. You’ll probably want to keep your notes together in one place-- whether that’s a physical journal or a document on your computer. This will make it easier to stay organized. Feel free to revisit your journal as you progress through the program, during your job hunt, and even as you settle into your new role as a data analyst.

- Chat (responsibly) with other learners: If you have a question, chances are, you’re not alone. Feel free to reach out in the discussion forum to ask for help from other learners taking this program. You can also visit Coursera’s Global Online Community. Other important things to know while you’re making friends can be found in the Coursera Honor Code and the Code of Conduct.
