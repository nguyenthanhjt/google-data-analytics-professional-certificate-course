# Deciding if you should take the speed track

- This reading provides an overview of a speed track we offer to those already familiar with data analytics.

- If you are brand new to data analytics, you can skip the diagnostic quiz after this reading, and move directly to the next activity: [Data analytics in everyday life](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/N5lvQ/data-analytics-in-everyday-life).

The Google Data Analytics Certificate is a program for anyone. A background in data analysis isn’t required. But you might be someone who has some experience already. If you are this type of learner, we have designed a speed track for this course. Learners who opt for the speed track can refresh on the basic topics and take each of the weekly challenges and the Course Challenge at a faster pace.

To help you decide if you’re a good match for the speed track for this course:

Take the optional [diagnostic quiz](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/quiz/4BXk3/optional-familiar-with-data-analytics-take-our-diagnostic-quiz).

Refer to the [scoring guide](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/supplement/V13Ie/your-diagnostic-quiz-score-and-what-it-means) to determine if you’re a good fit for the speed track. A score of 90% or higher is the target goal for someone on the speed track.

Based on your individual score, follow the recommendations in the scoring guide for your next steps.

Important reminder: If you’re eligible for the speed track, you’re still responsible to complete all graded activities. In order to earn your certificate, you will need an overall score of 80% or higher on all graded materials in the program.
