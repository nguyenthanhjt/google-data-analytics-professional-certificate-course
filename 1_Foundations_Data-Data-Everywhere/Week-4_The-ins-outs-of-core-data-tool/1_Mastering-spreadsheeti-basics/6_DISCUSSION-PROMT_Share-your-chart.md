# Share your chart

- As you continue working with data, you’ll find that feedback from others can help you gain a new perspective and reinforce your discoveries. In a previous lesson, you input your own data into a spreadsheet to generate a chart. Now, it’s time to use that chart to get valuable feedback. For this discussion, please submit the following:
- The chart generated from your data (make sure others can easily access your chart by taking a screenshot and attaching it as an image)
- A one-paragraph (50-100 words) description of what your chart is about
- A one-paragraph (50-100 words) summary of the changes you would make to your regular activities based on what you learned from the chart
Then, visit the [discussion forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/discussions) to read what other learners have written, and respond to at least two of them with your own thoughts.

The chart I created in Excel represents the amount of rice I consumed each day, measured in kilograms. The chart consists of two columns: "Date" and "Value." The "Date" column records the specific dates, while the "Value" column captures the corresponding amount of rice consumed on those dates. By tracking my rice consumption over time, this chart provides a visual representation of my eating habits and allows me to analyze any patterns or variations in my rice intake. It helps me monitor my daily rice consumption and make informed decisions about portion control or dietary adjustments if needed.

Based on the insights gained from the chart, I would consider making changes to my regular activities. For instance, if the chart reveals that my rice consumption is consistently exceeding the recommended daily amount, I might explore alternatives such as reducing portion sizes or substituting rice with other grains or vegetables in some meals. Additionally, if the chart shows significant fluctuations or irregularities in my rice intake, I may assess the factors contributing to those variations, such as specific events or occasions, and adjust my meal planning accordingly. Ultimately, the chart empowers me to be more conscious of my rice consumption and make informed choices to promote a balanced and healthy diet.
