1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.880
Spreadsheets are a big
part of data analytics.

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.270
The sooner you make friends

3
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.205
with spreadsheets, the better.

4
00:00:07.205 --> 00:00:09.950
Trust me, they'll save
you a lot of time as

5
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.775
a data analyst and make
your whole job easier.

6
00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:16.400
This spreadsheet is one example

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.340
of how an organized
spreadsheet might look.

8
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.695
In this video, we'll
demonstrate some of

9
00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:23.750
the basic spreadsheet
concepts for

10
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.195
all of you who are
new to this world.

11
00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:28.220
This might be a review
for some of you

12
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.035
more experienced
folks out there,

13
00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:33.115
but it never hurts to
practice what you know.

14
00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:36.145
Plus, you might still
learn a trick or two.

15
00:00:36.145 --> 00:00:38.035
I showed you this image earlier.

16
00:00:38.035 --> 00:00:41.180
Let's explore it further
because it's a great example of

17
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.280
the three main features
of a spreadsheet: cells,

18
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.130
rows, and columns.

19
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.080
They'll be part of
almost everything

20
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.790
you do in a
spreadsheet for making

21
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.900
a simple grocery list to
analyzing a complex dataset.

22
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.540
I use spreadsheets to
manage everything from

23
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.490
my own personal finances to

24
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.185
the annual homecoming party

25
00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.025
my friends and I
have every year.

26
00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:03.980
I'm the planner, so I use

27
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.795
a spreadsheet to keep
things in order,

28
00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:08.495
making sure we have
everything we need.

29
00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:10.685
Speaking of keeping
things in order,

30
00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:13.640
columns are organized vertically

31
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.080
in a spreadsheet and
are ordered by letter.

32
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.740
And the rows are organized

33
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.815
horizontally and are
ordered by number.

34
00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.470
So when you talk about
a specific cell,

35
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.900
you name it by combining
the column letter

36
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.865
and the row number where
the cell is located.

37
00:01:29.865 --> 00:01:32.419
For example, in
this spreadsheet,

38
00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:36.155
the word row is in cell D3.

39
00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:39.425
Let's get started in
an actual spreadsheet.

40
00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:41.660
You can complete
all of the steps

41
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.635
in just about any
spreadsheet program.

42
00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:48.765
Let's get to know your
spreadsheet a little better now.

43
00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:51.860
We'll start with some
basic operations.

44
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.275
Keep in mind, as an analyst,

45
00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:56.570
you won't always create
your own dataset.

46
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.060
But for now, let's do just that.

47
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:06.235
I'll click in cell A2 and
type my first name like this.

48
00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:12.010
Then I'll click in cell
B2 and type my last name.

49
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.575
Don't worry if your name
doesn't fit in the cell,

50
00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:20.965
you can always make columns
wider if you need to.

51
00:02:20.965 --> 00:02:23.410
All you have to do
is click and drag

52
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.890
the right edge of the column
until your name fits.

53
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.265
Or you can use the
text wrapping feature,

54
00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:33.010
which will set cells to
automatically change

55
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.040
their height to allow the
text in the cell to fit.

56
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.525
To use this feature,

57
00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:39.730
select the cells, columns,

58
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.345
or rows with text,

59
00:02:41.345 --> 00:02:43.600
then use the format menu

60
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.360
to look at the text
wrapping options.

61
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.700
It is automatically set to allow

62
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.220
the text to overflow
out of the cell.

63
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.780
But you can wrap the text

64
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.665
instead so all of
the text is visible.

65
00:02:55.665 --> 00:02:58.450
The clip option will
cut off the text in

66
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.215
the cell so only the text
that fits is visible.

67
00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:05.565
There it is. We've added data.

68
00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:07.520
Now let's label it.

69
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.330
This is important
for organization.

70
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.160
Adding labels to the top of

71
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.050
the columns will
make it easier to

72
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.940
reference and find data later

73
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.395
on when you're doing analysis.

74
00:03:18.395 --> 00:03:21.800
These column labels are
usually called attributes.

75
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.000
An attribute is a
characteristic or quality of

76
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.360
data used to label a
column in a table.

77
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.370
More commonly, attributes are

78
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.680
referred to as column names,

79
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.810
column labels, headers,

80
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.250
or the header row.

81
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.535
Let's add some
headers to our table.

82
00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:45.920
I'll click in cell A1 and
type the words first name.

83
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.410
In cell B1 I'll type last name.

84
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.470
We'll make these attributes
bold so they stand out more.

85
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.735
Spreadsheets can get really big,

86
00:04:00.735 --> 00:04:02.790
so you want to make
sure your data is

87
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.190
clearly labeled
and easy to find.

88
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.210
I can use my cursor to select

89
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.270
the cells with the attributes.

90
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.900
Then I'll click the bold
icon to make them bold.

91
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.765
Looking good so far.

92
00:04:14.765 --> 00:04:16.740
Ready to add some more data?

93
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.960
Let's start with
some new attributes.

94
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.260
First, I'll add a column for
the number of siblings by

95
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.530
typing siblings in cell C1.

96
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.200
Then I'll add two
more attributes

97
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.955
in the next two columns.

98
00:04:32.955 --> 00:04:37.215
Let's go with favorite
color and favorite dessert.

99
00:04:37.215 --> 00:04:40.200
I'll make them bold too.

100
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.825
To fit the labels in the cells,

101
00:04:42.825 --> 00:04:47.050
I'll adjust the size of the
columns just like before.

102
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.075
Now, keep in mind,

103
00:04:51.075 --> 00:04:52.770
there are more ways to adjust

104
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.410
the size of the
columns and rows.

105
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.260
If you have questions
about using spreadsheets,

106
00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.855
a quick search online will

107
00:04:59.855 --> 00:05:01.995
usually help you
find what you need.

108
00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:04.080
We've also included
a reading with

109
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.710
more tips and information
about spreadsheets.

110
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.900
OK, let's get back to it.

111
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.545
Now, I can add my own
data to the dataset.

112
00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:16.680
I'll type in how many
siblings I have and

113
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.610
my favorite color and dessert
in the appropriate cells.

114
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.070
Next, I'll add data
for two more people.

115
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.820
We now have three rows of data.

116
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.650
In a dataset, a row is also
called an observation.

117
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.610
An observation includes
all of the attributes

118
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.760
for something contained
in a row of a data table.

119
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.685
In this case, row 3
is an observation

120
00:05:50.685 --> 00:05:52.640
of Willa Stein because we

121
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.650
see all of her
attributes in this row.

122
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.130
So now we know spreadsheets let

123
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.915
you do lots of things with data.

124
00:05:59.915 --> 00:06:01.640
You can store and organize

125
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.195
data like we've done
in this spreadsheet.

126
00:06:04.195 --> 00:06:06.440
But you can go even further

127
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.600
and recognize existing data too.

128
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.135
Here, I'll show you how.

129
00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:14.150
Let's say we want to
organize our data

130
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.950
by how many siblings
each person has.

131
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.660
There's a simple way to do that.

132
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.830
First, we'll need to select
all of our columns with

133
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.835
data so that all of it
is reorganized together.

134
00:06:25.835 --> 00:06:29.090
Then we can go to our data menu.

135
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.580
Here we have some options.

136
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.085
Let's select sort range.

137
00:06:34.085 --> 00:06:38.160
This will let us choose how
to organize the column.

138
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.865
Next, we'll choose A to Z,

139
00:06:42.865 --> 00:06:44.680
which will organize
our numbers in

140
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.080
order from smallest to largest.

141
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.545
Now, we want to watch
out for header row,

142
00:06:50.545 --> 00:06:52.435
which is the word siblings,

143
00:06:52.435 --> 00:06:54.390
the attribute for this column.

144
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.635
We'll check this box.

145
00:06:56.635 --> 00:07:00.770
This makes sure the word
siblings stays in place.

146
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.790
Now we're ready to sort.

147
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.000
Voila, we just reorganized

148
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.560
our data by sorting it from

149
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.095
the smallest number
to the largest.

150
00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:12.820
As we go further,

151
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.230
you discover lots of

152
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.960
other ways to work with
data in a spreadsheet,

153
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.470
including functions
and formulas.

154
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.375
Let's finish with a quick
example of a formula.

155
00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:24.280
You can think of formulas as

156
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.295
one way of manipulating
data in a spreadsheet.

157
00:07:27.295 --> 00:07:31.495
Formulas are like a
calculator, but more powerful.

158
00:07:31.495 --> 00:07:34.960
A formula is a set of
instructions that performs

159
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.465
a specific action using
the data in a spreadsheet.

160
00:07:38.465 --> 00:07:40.600
To do this, the formula uses

161
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.795
cell references for the
values it's calculating.

162
00:07:43.795 --> 00:07:47.100
Let me show you. Here we go.

163
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.510
We'll click in the next cell
in the siblings column.

164
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.390
Then we'll type an equal sign.

165
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.435
All formulas begin
with this symbol.

166
00:07:59.435 --> 00:08:03.585
Next, we'll type in the cells
we want to add together.

167
00:08:03.585 --> 00:08:10.275
In this case, we'll type
in C2 plus C3 plus C4.

168
00:08:10.275 --> 00:08:12.940
Now we can press "Enter".

169
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.680
There it is. The
formula has given us

170
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.355
the total number of siblings
represented in this dataset.

171
00:08:20.355 --> 00:08:23.175
We've just analyzed some data.

172
00:08:23.175 --> 00:08:26.070
We'll want to store the
data for later use.

173
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.170
In Google sheets,
a spreadsheet is

174
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.885
automatically saved
in your Google Drive.

175
00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.435
For Excel and other
spreadsheets,

176
00:08:33.435 --> 00:08:35.445
you'll save them as a file.

177
00:08:35.445 --> 00:08:38.610
Now you know some basics
