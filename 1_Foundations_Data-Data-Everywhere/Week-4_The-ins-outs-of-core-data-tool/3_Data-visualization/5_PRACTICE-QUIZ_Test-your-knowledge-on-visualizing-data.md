- attributed
- contextual
- tabulated
- graphical -> `A data visualization is the graphical representation of information.`

## 2. When would a pie chart be an effective visualization?

Choose the right on in these answer:

1. When showing the relationship between age and income
2. When showing the ages of males versus females
3. When showing a change in someone's age over time
4. When showing a class broken down by age -> `true` - `A pie chart shows how a whole is broken down into parts and is an effective visualization for a class broken down by age.`

## 3. What are the key benefits of data visualizations? Select all that apply

1. They can help stakeholders understand complex data more quickly -> `true` - `Data visualizations can clearly demonstrate patterns and trends, help stakeholders understand complex data more quickly, and illustrate relationships between data points.`
2. They can illustrate relationships between data points -> `true` - `Data visualizations can clearly demonstrate patterns and trends, help stakeholders understand complex data more quickly, and illustrate relationships between data points.`
3. They can ensure that you get fewer questions about your analysis
4. They can clearly demonstrate patterns and trends -> `true` - `Data visualizations can clearly demonstrate patterns and trends, help stakeholders understand complex data more quickly, and illustrate relationships between data points`

## Notes

### Pie Chart

A pie chart can be an effective visualization in the following situations:

Showing parts of a whole: Pie charts are great for illustrating how individual components contribute to the overall composition of a dataset. When you want to showcase the relative proportions or percentages of different categories, a pie chart can quickly convey the distribution of data.

Limited number of categories: Pie charts work best when you have a small number of categories to represent. Too many categories can make the chart crowded and difficult to interpret. Ideally, you should aim for no more than 5-6 categories to keep the pie chart clear and readable.

Emphasizing comparisons: Pie charts are useful when you want to emphasize the differences or similarities between categories. By comparing the sizes of the slices, it becomes easier to identify which categories are larger or smaller in relation to one another.

Simple data exploration: If your goal is to provide a high-level overview or a quick snapshot of the data without getting into intricate details, a pie chart can serve as a straightforward and visually appealing option.

It's worth noting that pie charts have some limitations. They can be less effective when it comes to precise comparisons of values or displaying trends over time. In such cases, alternative visualizations like bar charts or line graphs may be more suitable.
