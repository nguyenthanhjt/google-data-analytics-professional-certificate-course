# Visualizations in daily life

Data visualization makes data easier to understand and reveals patterns and trends. Now it's time to bring this knowledge into your everyday life. Doing so will help you become more comfortable thinking like a data analyst.

For this discussion prompt, consider the following:

- What data do you use every day? How is that data presented? For instance, if you ride the train in the morning and evening, the transit schedule and train map are data visualizations that you use every day.
- Before you started this program, how did you think about data visualization? What did it mean to you? What do you think about data visualization now?

Submit two or more paragraphs (100-200 words total). Then, visit the discussion forum
to read what other learners have written, and respond to at least two of them with your own thoughts.

Before starting this program, I primarily thought of data visualization as graphs and charts used in business reports or scientific research papers. It seemed like a tool exclusively used by professionals in data analysis or research fields. I understood its purpose of presenting data in a visually appealing and digestible way, but I didn't see its relevance in my everyday life.

However, as I progressed through this program and learned more about data visualization, I realized that it is much more pervasive than I initially thought. Data visualization is not limited to formal reports or scientific studies; it is all around us in our daily lives. For instance, weather forecasts on TV or smartphone apps use data visualizations to represent temperature, precipitation, and other meteorological information. Social media platforms display graphs and charts to show engagement metrics, such as likes, comments, and shares. Even simple things like maps, traffic signs, and restaurant menus incorporate data visualization to convey information efficiently.

Nowadays, I have a deeper appreciation for data visualization and recognize its significance in making complex information more accessible and understandable. I see it as a powerful tool that can help me make informed decisions, gain insights, and communicate ideas effectively. It has broadened my perspective on how data is presented and how it can be utilized to enhance various aspects of my everyday life.

Before starting this program, I had a limited understanding of data visualization. I viewed it as something primarily used by professionals in specialized fields, such as data analysis or scientific research. It seemed distant from my everyday life, and I didn't fully grasp its relevance or potential impact.

However, as I delve deeper into this program and continue to learn about data visualization, my perception is evolving. I am starting to recognize the prevalence of data visualization in various aspects of my daily life. For example, weather apps use visualizations to present forecasts, social media platforms incorporate graphs and charts to display engagement metrics, and even simple things like maps and menus utilize visual elements to convey information efficiently.

This program has opened my eyes to the power of data visualization in making complex data more accessible and understandable. I am now beginning to appreciate its role in decision-making, gaining insights, and effective communication. Although I am still in the process of learning and expanding my knowledge, I am excited about the potential for data visualization to enhance my understanding and engagement with the world around me.

Hello Guys!
Prior to now, I do see Data visualization at most to be information reformatted into simple inserted  data in MS word at most, nothing quarterly as detailed and interpretative as I have come to practice, utilize and engage in in the program of this course.

Right now, I am super convinced at the qualitative level of expression data visualization has come to, it's mind striking , how absolutely every form of data that there is can be transcribed [as I could think it to be] into one form of data or the other from charts to graphs to bars to its literal representation from the spreadsheets to more colors and shapes highlighting significant information to appear more alive than leaving them to words and rows and columns alone. 

Now, from my time spent in certain activities to means of transportation to career growth even to monitoring the rate of growth or downside of customers in businesses of my friend can be graphically transcribed to a more convince statement where everyone can assimilate at a first/short glance.

Daily examples of data visualization include: 

-I've started a small YouTube channel and I view data, like monthly views and subscribers, with bar and line graphs. 

-My credit score is viewed either through a line graph or a gradient scale chart. 

-Being unable to drive, I use google maps a lot to get around and to view/ compare different types of businesses. This includes visuals like the five-star rating system, a simple money expense/cost level, color-coded text showing if a business is open or closed, and of course the actual map. 

-When I do my shopping online, I always look at ratings and reviews, which are shown through the five star rating system and a bar graph. 

Previously, I had occasionally appreciated the effectiveness or visual interest of data design, just because I like different mediums of design and because I appreciate clear communication. However, I'm starting to appreciate that it is truly imperative to communicate data clearly, concisely, and that promotes intrigue. In previous discussion posts, I've mentioned times where I created materials for my coworkers so they could complete tasks on their own when I wasn't there. But, even though I did put effort and consideration into these projects, because they were just a service and not part of my job, I now know that I didn't thoroughly vet them and make them as clear and approachable as they could have been. Effective data visualization can truly support the success of the company, while poor data visualization can be a detriment.
