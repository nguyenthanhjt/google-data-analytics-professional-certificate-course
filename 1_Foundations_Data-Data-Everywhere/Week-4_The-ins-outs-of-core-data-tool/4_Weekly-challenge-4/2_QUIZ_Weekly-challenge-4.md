## 7 A data analyst has to create a visualization that makes it easy to show which of the top ten most populous cities in North Carolina have a population below 250,000 people. What type of chart would be best for this visualization?

Scatter chart
Pie chart
Line chart
Bar chart  => true

The best type of chart for visualizing the population of the top ten most populous cities in North Carolina, specifically showing which cities have a population below 250,000 people, would be a Bar Chart.

A Bar Chart is a great choice for comparing the population of different cities because it allows you to easily see the population values for each city and make comparisons between them. The horizontal axis can represent the cities, while the vertical axis represents the population count. Each bar will represent a city, and the height of the bar will correspond to the population size of that city.

Using different colors or patterns for bars with populations below 250,000 and above 250,000 would allow you to quickly identify which cities fall into each category.

On the other hand, a Scatter Chart is typically used to display the relationship between two continuous variables and is not well-suited for this specific task. A Pie Chart is suitable for showing proportions or percentages of a whole, which doesn't fit the requirement of comparing individual population values. A Line Chart is useful for visualizing trends over time, which is not relevant for this particular scenario.

## 8 A data analyst has to demonstrate a trend of how something has changed over time. What type of chart is best for this task?

Line
Area
Bar
Column =>

For demonstrating a trend of how something has changed over time, the best type of chart would be a Line Chart.

A Line Chart is specifically designed to show the relationship and trends between data points over a continuous time period. It is particularly effective when you want to visualize changes or fluctuations in a variable over time, as it allows you to see the overall trend and identify patterns, ups and downs, or any other temporal variations easily.

In a Line Chart, the x-axis represents the time scale, and the y-axis represents the values of the variable being analyzed. Each data point is plotted on the chart, and lines are drawn to connect the points, showing the continuous progression of the data over time.

Both Area Charts and Column Charts can also be used to some extent to display trends over time. However, Line Charts are generally preferred when the emphasis is on illustrating a continuous change over a period, making them the most appropriate choice for this task.
