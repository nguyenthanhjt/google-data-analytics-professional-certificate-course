# Use pivot tables in analysis

In this reading, you will learn how to create and use pivot tables for data analysis. You will also get some resources about pivot tables that you can save for your own reference when you start creating pivot tables yourself. **Pivot tables** are a spreadsheet tool that let you view data in multiple ways to find insights and trends.

Pivot tables allow you to make sense of large data sets by giving you tools to easily compare metrics, quickly perform calculations, and generate readable reports. You can create a pivot table to help you answer specific questions about your data.
