# Use pivot tables in analysis

In this reading, you will learn how to create and use pivot tables for data analysis. You will also get some resources about pivot tables that you can save for your own reference when you start creating pivot tables yourself. **Pivot tables** are a spreadsheet tool that let you view data in multiple ways to find insights and trends.

Pivot tables allow you to make sense of large data sets by giving you tools to easily compare metrics, quickly perform calculations, and generate readable reports. You can create a pivot table to help you answer specific questions about your data. For example, if you were analyzing sales data, you could use pivot tables to answer questions like, “Which month had the most sales?” and “What products generated the most revenue this year?” When you need answers to questions about your data, pivot tables can help you cut through the clutter and focus on only the data you need.

## Create your pivot table

Before you can analyze data with pivot tables, you will need to create a pivot table with your data. The following includes the steps for creating a pivot table in Google Sheets, but most spreadsheet programs will have similar tools.

1. Open the **Insert** menu from the toolbar; there will be an option for **Pivot table**.
