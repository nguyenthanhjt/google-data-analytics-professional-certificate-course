## **Question 1:** In this spreadsheet, which function will sum only the values from column B that cost more than $40?

- [x] `=SUMIF(B2:B12,">40")`
- [ ] `=SUMIF(B2:B12,>40)`
- [ ] `B:=SUMIF(B2:B12,"<40")`
- [ ] `=SUMIF(B2:B12,<40)`

> To sum only the values from column B that cost more than $40, the function is =SUMIF(B2:B12,">40"). B2:B12 is the range, and more than 40 (>40) is the criteria.

## **Question 2:** Fill in the blank: The spreadsheet function _____ returns the number of cells within a range that match a specified value

- [ ] VALUE
- [ ] COUNT DISTINCT
- [ ] ARRAY
- [x] **COUNTIF**

> The spreadsheet function COUNTIF returns the number of cells within a range that match a specified value. The syntax is =COUNTIF(range, criteria).

## **Question 3:** What is an example of an array in a spreadsheet?

- [ ] All cells with number values
- [x] **The values in cells B2 through B31**
- [ ] All cells with values greater than 100
- [ ] Cells D7, E14, and F20

> The values in cells B2 through B31 is an example of an array. An array is a collection of values in spreadsheet cells.

## **Question 4:** Which function will calculate the sum of the products of the corresponding items in the arrays M1:M4 and P1:P4?

- [x] **`=SUMPRODUCT(M1:M4, P1:P4)`**
- [ ] `=MULTIPLY(M1:M4, P1:P4)`
- [ ] `=PRODUCT(M1:M4, P1:P4)`
- [ ] `=ARRAY(M1:M4, P1:P4)`

> The function =SUMPRODUCT(M1:M4, P1:P4) will calculate the sum of the products of the corresponding items in the arrays M1:M4 and P1:P4. This means it will multiply the corresponding items in each array, then add the products together.
