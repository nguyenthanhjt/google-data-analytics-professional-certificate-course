# Video: Check and recheck

Video transcript

- Hi again.
- Earlier we covered data validation, a spreadsheet function that adds drop down lists to cells.
- Using data validation lets you control what can and can't be entered into your worksheet.
- One of its uses is protecting structured data and formulas in your spreadsheets.
- But as useful as it is, the data validation function is just one part of a larger data validation process.
- This process involves checking and rechecking the quality of your data, so that it is complete, accurate, secure, and consistent.
- While the data validation process is a form of data cleaning, you should use it throughout your analysis.
- If this all sounds familiar to you, that's good.
- Ensuring you have good data is super important.
- In my opinion, it's fun because you can pair your knowledge of the business with your technical skills.
- This will help you understand your data, check that it's clean, and make sure you're aligning with your business objectives.
- In other words, it's what you do to make sure your data makes sense.
- Keep in mind you'll build your business knowledge with time and experience.
- Here's a pro-tip, asking as many questions as possible whenever you need to will make this much easier.
- Let's say we're analyzing some data for a furniture retailer.
- We want to check that the values in the purchase price column are always equal to the number of items sold times the product price.
- We'll add a formula and a new column to recalculate the purchase prices using a multiplication formula.
- Now comparing the totals, there's at least one value that doesn't match the value in the purchase price column.
- We need to find an answer to help us move forward with our analysis.
- By doing some research and asking questions, we find that there's a discount of 30% when customers buy five or more certain items.
- If we hadn't run this check, we could have missed this completely.
- You've learned that as an analyst, calculations are a big part of your job.
- It's important that whenever you do calculations, you always check to make sure you've done them in the right way.
- Sometimes you'll run data validation checks that are common sense checks.
- For example, let's say you're working on an analysis to figure out the effectiveness of in store promotions for a business that's only open on weekdays.
- You check to make sure that there's no sales data for Saturday and Sundays.
- If your data does show sales on weekends, it might not be a problem with the data itself.
- It might not even be a problem at all.
- There might be a good reason.
- Like maybe your business hosts special events on Saturdays and Sundays, then you would have sales for those weekends.
- You still might want to leave out the weekend sales in your analysis if your objective is only to look at the weekdays.
- But doing the state of validation might save you from miscalculations and other errors in your analysis.
- You should always do data validation no matter what analysis tool you're using.
- In an earlier video, we use SQL to analyze some data about avocados.
- One of the queries was a check to make sure the data showing the total number of bags was the sum of small, large, and extra large bags.
- By running this query, we were able to determine that the total number column was accurate.
- That led us to continue our analysis.
- But when we tried to find what percent of the total number of bags was small, we ran into a small problem.
- We received an error message about dividing by zero.
- We fix that error by adjusting our query.
- If we had linked that query to a presentation that went to our stakeholders, they'd show us the divide by zero error instead of the figures we wanted.
- By building in these types of checks, as part of your data validation process, you can avoid errors in your analysis and complete your business objectives to make everyone happy.
- Trust me, it's a great feeling when you do.
- Another great feeling is knowing that you've made it through another video and learned something new.
- We have more where that came from coming soon.
- See you.
