# Always a need to organize

Video transcript

- Hi again.
- Let's jump back in.
- Right now we're in the Analyze phase of the data analysis process.
- And even though each phase is unique, data analysts make decisions about organization throughout all of them.

That's what we're talking about here: organization.
- It's super important that you keep your data organized throughout your analysis.
- How your data is classified and structured will impact your findings, whether you're working in a spreadsheet or a database.
- And once you know how your data is organized, you'll be able to capture or collect the information you need.
- Most of the data you'll use in your analysis will be organized in tables.
- Tables help you organize similar kinds of data into categories and subject areas that you can focus on as you analyze.
- For example, this basic database has tables for car dealerships, product details, and repair parts.
- Each table then has several fields of data, like branch owner and the cost of repair parts.
- You can use these tables and fields to help you decide how to move forward with your analysis.
- The structure of this database can help you decide which data you need to pull to meet your objectives.
- For example, the total number of a particular brand of car sold, or a repair part for a specific make and model of a car at a certain branch.

Tables allow you to make decisions about data types.
- They help you to figure out what variables you need and the data type those variables should have.
- So if you have a database where you need to convert a data type during your analysis, you can do that by using the CAST command in SQL or any other method that you learn on the job or from your own research.
- Like this example where we converted a purchase price column to be a FLOAT instead of a STRING so that it was in a numerical form we could use for calculations.
- If you're performing your analysis in a spreadsheet, you want to make sure that the columns and rows are effectively organized.
- You can even hide columns that you won't need for analysis or that show duplicate information.
- Once you have the data organized and formatted, you'll be ready to sort and filter it to find the data you need.
- We'll cover sorting and filtering soon.
- But for now, just know that both filters and sorts are affected by the type of data we're working with.
- The bottom line is that it's important to have your data in the right format.
- So always be prepared to adjust, no matter how far into your analysis you are.
- That's all for now.
- Coming up, we'll show you what filters are all about.
- Bye!

## Question

### Quetion 1: Fill in the blank: _____ involves arranging data into a meaningful order to make it easier to understand, analyze, and visualize

- `Sorting`
- Organizing
- Filtering
- Prioritizing

> Sorting involves arranging data into a meaningful order to make it easier to understand, analyze, and visualize.

### Questio 2: To narrow the scope of a query, a data analyst filters by a particular criteria. This type of filtering must be done one variable at a time

- True
- `False`

> Filtering can be done by single variable or multiple variables, depending on the queryâ€™s needs.

## Keypoints

- **Importance of Organization**: The video stresses the significance of keeping data organized throughout the analysis process. Whether working in a spreadsheet or a database, the way data is classified and structured has a direct impact on the findings.
- **Tables for Organization**: Tables are highlighted as a fundamental means of organizing data. They assist in categorizing and structuring similar kinds of data into distinct categories and subject areas. For instance, a database may have tables for car dealerships, product details, and repair parts.
- **Decision-Making with Tables**: The structure of tables aids in making informed decisions about data types. Analysts can determine the necessary variables and their respective data types. The example of converting a purchase price column from STRING to FLOAT in SQL is provided, showcasing the flexibility of adjusting data types.
- **Effective Spreadsheet Organization**: In a spreadsheet, columns and rows need to be effectively organized. This may involve hiding unnecessary columns or those containing duplicate information. The goal is to have the data organized and formatted appropriately for further analysis.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Once the data is organized and formatted, the next steps involve sorting and filtering to identify the required information. The video hints at covering these topics in more detail later.
- **Adaptability**: The section concludes with the reminder that it's essential to have data in the right format, and analysts should be prepared to make adjustments at any stage of the analysis.
