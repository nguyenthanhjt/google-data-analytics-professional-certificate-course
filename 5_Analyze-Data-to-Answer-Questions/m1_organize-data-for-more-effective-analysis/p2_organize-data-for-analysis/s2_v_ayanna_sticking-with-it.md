# Ayanna: Sticking with it

Video transcript

- I think one of the coolest things about working with data at Google is that we have one of the world's, most valuable datasets.
- People refer to Google data as really a lens into human curiosity.
- We often look at Google as really a proxy for what's happening in the world.
- And so for many of our advertisers, they really, really value the data and the insights that we're able to give them from Google because they believe it's a proxy or a reflection of what's happening in their business or within their industry.
- And so I think the value of the data that we're able to work with at Google really keeps me interested and excited about the work that I do.
- So I came to Google about three years ago after spending a few years in consulting.
- And so I was really interested in switching into a role that was really focused on sales and marketing.
- But at the same time, I still wanted to be able to leverage the analytical skill set that I had gained prior.
- This role was a great complement to the skillsets that I already had and the interest that I had in moving into the sales and marketing function.
- I think one important thing for all students to realize is that no one learns this material overnight.
- Many of your colleagues you may look at as experts, but most likely they've been able to gain that level of expertise through their years within the field.
- I think one of the biggest attributes that students should keep in mind is that the most important thing that they need to have throughout this learning journey is grit.
- Grit to understand that it may be a struggle, it may be a challenge, but if you put in the work, you put in the time, these concepts will eventually click, and you'll be well on your way to becoming a data analyst.
- Hi, my name is Ayanna and I'm a global insights manager here at Google.
