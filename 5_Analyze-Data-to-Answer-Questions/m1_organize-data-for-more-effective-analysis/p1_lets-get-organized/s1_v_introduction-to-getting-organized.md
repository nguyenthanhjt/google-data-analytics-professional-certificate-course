Video transcript

- Hey there, future data analysts! You've made a lot of progress so far.
- It's not an easy journey, but you're doing great.
- Before you started this program, something inside of you convinced you to get your Google Data Analytics Certificate.
- You had an idea, did some research, and made the time to get started.
- Then you made the decision to commit to your goal.
- Now look where you are! That is something to be proud of.
- Early on, we jumped right into the world of data analytics and saw how data played a part in your everyday life.
- You learned how to navigate spreadsheets and why structured thinking was key to solving problems.
- You also explored the best ways to collect and store your data.
- From there, you gained an understanding of clean data and data integrity.
- You've identified how to ask the right questions and learned to clean data.
- Now we'll take your skills to the next level.
- Next up, you'll learn how to come up with clear and objective answers to any data question you encounter.
- Earlier, we learned about the data analysis process.
- As a quick reminder, the phases of that process are Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
- We'll explore the Analyze phase more here, focusing on how to organize and format the data you have so that you can do all sorts of calculations.
- Knowing how to analyze the data you've collected and cleaned is essential to your work as an analyst.
- Before we get started, I'd like to introduce myself.
- My name is Ayanna, and I'm excited to be your instructor for this course.
- I'm a global insights manager at Google, and I've also taught at the Google Analytics Academy, which is a training resource for Google analysts.
- In my job, I help advertisers determine the value of investing in Google products.
- When you search for something online, you'll often see an ad on the page.
- That's an investment an advertiser has made.
- I use data analysis to show advertisers the value they could gain from investing in those ads.
- That's what I love about being a data analyst: figuring out how to create value anytime I enter a situation.
- The best way to know if you're creating value is if you have evidence.
- For me, that evidence is data.
- Now that you know a little bit about my love for data, let's talk about what you'll learn here.
- You'll start by covering best practices for organizing your data and the different ways you can sort through that data using spreadsheets and SQL.
- We'll also spend time learning three important ways to work with data that will boost your analytical skills.
- Then we'll talk about saving time.
- You'll discover tips and tricks that can help you analyze data more efficiently.
- Last but not least, we'll work together to identify techniques to help you be as fair and unbiased as possible.
- Well, that's all you need to know for now.
- Coming up, we'll break down the basics of data analysis and bring you one step closer to a future in data.
