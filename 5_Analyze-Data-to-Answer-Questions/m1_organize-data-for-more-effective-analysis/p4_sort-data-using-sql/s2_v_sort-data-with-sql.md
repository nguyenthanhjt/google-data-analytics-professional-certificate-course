# Sort data with SQL

Video transcript

- Hello there! If you're hoping to learn about sorting—in SQL this time— you've definitely come to the right place.
- So far, we've sorted spreadsheets through the menu and with a written function.
- Which brings us to the next part of our learning: more sort functions, but this time in SQL.
- Data analysts love playing with the way data is presented.
- Sorting is a useful way to rearrange data because it can help you understand the data you have in a different light.
- As you've probably already noticed, a lot of things you can do in spreadsheets can also be done in SQL.
- Sorting is one of those things.
- We've talked about using SQL with large datasets before.
- When a spreadsheet has too much data, you can get error messages, or it can cause your program to crash.
- That's definitely something we want to avoid.
- SQL shortens processes that would otherwise take a very long time or be impossible to complete in a spreadsheet.
- Personally, I use SQL to pull and combine different data tables.
- It's much quicker than a spreadsheet, and that usually comes in handy.
- Here's something pretty helpful you can do with SQL.
- You can use the ORDER BY clause to sort results returned in a query.
- Let's go back to our movie spreadsheet to get a better idea of how this works.
- Feel free to follow along in a SQL tool of your choice as we go.
- As a quick refresher, we have a database of movies listed with data like release date, director, and more.
- We can sort this table in lots of different ways using the ORDER BY function.
- For this example, let's sort by release date.
- First, we have the SELECT function and an asterisk.
- Keep in mind that the asterisk means all columns are selected.
- Then we have FROM and the name of the database and table we're in right now.
- Now let's check out the next line.
- It's empty, but that's where we'll write our ORDER BY function.
- The ORDER BY command is usually the last clause in your query.
- Back to the actual sorting! We'll type ORDER BY with the space.
- With this clause, you can choose to order data by fields in a certain column.
- Because we want to sort by release date, we'll type Release_Date.
- By default, the ORDER BY clause sorts data in ascending order.
- If you run the query as it is right now, the movies will be sorted from oldest to the most recent release dates.
- Let's run the query and see what we've got.
- You can also sort the release dates in the reverse order from the most recent dates to the oldest.
- To do this, just specify the descending order in the ORDER BY command written as DESC, D-E-S-C.
- Let's run this query.
- As you'll notice, the most recently released films are now at the top of the database.
- In spreadsheets, you can combine sorts and filters to display information differently.
- You can do something similar in SQL too.
- You might remember that while sorting puts data in a specific order, filters narrow down data, so you only see data that fits the filter.
- For example, let's say we want to filter movies by genre so that we're only working with comedies.
- But we still want release dates to be sorted in descending order, from most recent to oldest films.
- We can do this with the WHERE clause.
- Let's try that now.
- First, we'll check that the ORDER BY clause is always the last line.
- That makes sure that all the results of the query you're running are sorted by that clause.
- Then, we'll add a new line for the WHERE clause after FROM and before ORDER BY.
- Here's what we've got so far.
- From there, we want to type the column we're filtering for.
- In this case, we want to filter the database for comedies.
- After the WHERE clause, we'll type the column list's name as Genre.
- Now, we'll add an equal sign after Genre because we only want to include genres that match what we're filtering for.
- In this case, we're filtering for comedy, so we'll type Comedy between two apostrophes.
- Now, if you check out the entire query as a whole, you'll notice that we're selecting all columns, and we know it's all columns because that's what an asterisk means.
- The FROM clause specifies the name of the movie database we're using, and the WHERE clause filters the data to include entries whose genre is specified as comedy.
- Then in the last line, we have the ORDER BY clause, which will sort the data we've chosen to filter by release dates in descending order.
- This means when we run the query, we'll only have comedy movies listed from newest releases to oldest releases.
- Let's run it and figure out if that's the case.
- Cool.
- Check out all those comedy movies and the way those dates are sorted.
- Now, let's take this query a step further.
- We'll filter for two conditions at once using the AND filter.
- Working off the query we've been using, we'll add a second condition in the WHERE clause.
- We'll keep the sorting the same.
- Let's say you wanted to filter by comedy movies and movies that earned over 300 million in the box office.
- In this case, after the AND function, you'd add the revenue condition by typing Revenue.
- From there, you'll specify that you only want to return films with revenues over $300 million.
- To do that, type the greater than sign and then the complete number of 300 million without commas.
- Now let's run the query.
- Here, the data only shows comedy movies with revenues of over $300 million, and it's sorted in descending order by release date.
- It looks really good.
- You just filtered and sorted a database like it's your job.
- And with practice, one day it can be.
- Just like that, you've finished another step in your data analyst journey.
- By now, you really dug and learned about the analysis process with a special emphasis on how organization can change how you go through your data.
- You also learned about both spreadsheets and SQL, and how to sort and filter data in both types of programs.
- To help you get more comfortable using spreadsheet and SQL features, you'll be getting some materials you can use as a resource.
- Coming up, we'll check out how an organizational mindset can take your analytical skills even further.
- We'll also cover converting, formatting, and adjusting data to combine information in a way that makes sense.
- Learning those skills early on can make your work as a data analyst much more efficient and effective in the long run.
- See you soon.
