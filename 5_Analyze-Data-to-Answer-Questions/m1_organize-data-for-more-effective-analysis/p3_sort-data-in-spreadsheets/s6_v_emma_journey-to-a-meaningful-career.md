# Emma: Journey to a meaningful career

- I'm Emma, and I'm a product analyst on Google Health.
- The product that I am helping analyze data for is a tool for clinicians, and what this is going to allow clinicians to do is find their patients' health data just as easily as you can find data on Google Search.
- What I specifically focus on is standardizing health care data, analyzing it to find anomalies or data quality issues, and talking to product managers about which features we should launch and why.
- I've worked on problems from solving locomotive failures in predicting them before they happen, to forecasting sales for handbags before the handbag is even launched, to now working with health care data to try to allow clinicians to easily have their patients' data at their fingertips.
- I was really interested in working in data analytics, but I was trying to figure out what type of data I wanted to work with or what field within data analytics I wanted to focus on because there are so many.
- I was ultimately drawn towards working with health care data.
- I just really fell in love with all of the problems that we have today in health care and how just this vast amount of data that's available in the health care industry could be better utilized to help patients, to help clinicians, to improve population health.
- Working with meaningful datasets is what really makes me excited to come to work every day and excited to solve these problems.
- What I've found in my career is that following the datasets that interested me, the types of problems that interested me, always yielded better results because I was just that much more driven to go to work every day to do my best to solve these interesting problems because it's just what interested me.
- The amazing thing is there's data everywhere, there are data problems at every company in every field, and you really get to just follow what you're passionate about.
