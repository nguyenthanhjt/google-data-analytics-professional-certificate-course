# Practice Quiz - Self-Reflection: Stack Overflow

## Activity overview

In this activity, you’ll learn how to ask the data analytics community questions about the tools and programming languages you’ve been using in this course. You’ll examine best practices for writing questions, which can help you refine the questions you ask. Knowing where to find help and how to ask questions makes you a more efficient data analyst.

### Why Use the Stack Overflow Platform to Get Help

All data professionals get stuck at times and have questions. Fortunately,  there are many resources available and a dynamic community to help. One such resource is Stack Overflow.

Stack Overflow is an online platform where data analysts and programmers ask code-related questions, and peers suggest answers. It provides an outlet for quick problem-solving and access to a wide-ranging knowledge base with networking and career development opportunities. You can ask questions about tools, programming languages, and much more.

### Step-By-Step Instructions

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then answer the question at the end of the activity before going to the next course item.

### Step 1: Sign up for a Stack Overflow account

If you do not have an account, complete the following steps to sign up for Stack Overflow.

1. Navigate to the [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) website.
2. Select the **Sign up** button.
3. Enter the display name you want to use, your email address, a password, and any other required information.
4. Select **Sign up**.
5. Once you’ve signed up for your account, Stack Overflow will send you an email to complete your registration. Select the **Complete your registration** link.

7. You’ll be redirected to a welcome screen that provides you with an overview of the features and capabilities on Stack Overflow, as well as some how-to instruction.

### Step 2: Explore Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow has several resources you can use to search for information, including a Questions feature, a Tags feature, and a Search bar to help you find answers to the questions you might have.

#### Questions

The Questions page provides different categories of questions for you to choose from. Some examples include Newest, Active, and Unanswered. To view all questions:

1. Select the Navigation menu (an icon of three stacked horizontal lines).
2. Select Questions.

Explore the types of questions listed under the different categories.

#### Tags

Tags are keywords or labels that can help you find questions. To view the Tags page:

1. Open the Navigation menu, then select Tags.

To search for a specific tag:

1. Enter a tag name in the search bar, then press enter.
2. Select any tag to view a list of questions that have that particular tag.

Different types of tags that you can search for include:

- Product lines
- Projects
- Teams
- Specific technologies
- Specific languages

You can also examine this [list of existing tags](https://stackoverflow.com/tags) for examples of which tags to use.

#### Search bar

Use the Search bar to search for keywords and questions. To view only questions with a specific tag, include the tag name in brackets within your search. For example, if you want to only find questions that have the tag “SQL,” then type [SQL] in the search field along with your keywords or question.

To learn more about searching, read these [instructions on how to search](https://stackoverflow.com/help/searching). For a quick guide on how different syntax structures can help you search more efficiently, go to this list of [search types and search syntax](https://stackoverflow.com/search).

### Step 3: Ask your own question

To ask your own question, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Stack Overflow homepage. Select Home from the Navigation menu or the Stack Overflow icon.
2. Select Ask Question. Note: If you need additional help, Stack Overflow displays some helpful tips for writing a good question and provides external links for additional resources.
3. Enter a title for your question. Make sure it’s specific! Then, select Next.
4. Enter the details of the problem you’re experiencing. Introduce the problem and explain the circumstances in which you encountered it. Then, select Next.
5. Add a description about what you tried, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened. If applicable, add a minimal, reproducible example of the code you’ve written so that someone can try to reproduce the issue. To insert a section of code, select Ctrl+K on your keyboard. Then, enter your code. When you have completed your description, select Next.
6. Add up to five tags that help describe your question. These tags will help to make sure your question is answered by the right people. Then, select Next.
7. Stack Overflow provides you with the ability to review questions that have already been asked to see if your question is a duplicate. The Stack Overflow community discourages repeat questions, so make sure to check previous questions thoroughly. If you find your question in the results listed, select that question and the hyperlink will redirect you to that question’s page in a new tab. You can also select Discard draft at the bottom of the form on the Ask a public question page. 
8. If you don’t see your question listed, check the box to confirm that none of the posts answer your question. Then, select Review your question.
9. Review all the fields where you entered information about your question. If you need to make any changes, you can do so in the provided text boxes. If everything is correct, select Post your question.

**Note**: Stack Overflow is a public forum. Do not post any private information or confidential details.

### Follow Best Practices for Writing your own questions

The following best practices can help set you up for success when asking questions on Stack Overflow:

- Keep it specific.
- Don’t use Stack Overflow to ask questions with opinion-based answers. For example:
  - “Which SQL function can I use to add two numbers together?” is an appropriate question.
  - “Which SQL function is your favorite?” is not.
- Before asking a question, search the Stack Overflow website first—someone may have already asked it. This reduces the number of redundant questions on the site and saves you time.
- Write clear and concise questions in complete sentences. People are more likely to understand what you are asking and can give you more specific or helpful answers.

## Reflection

### Question 1

You’re a junior data analyst working for a local news station and your team uses BigQuery to analyze weather trends. The station’s meteorologist has tasked you with understanding the relationship between wind speed and visibility in 2023. However, you’re working with the newest data and it hasn’t been cleaned yet. Missing values were incorrectly entered as zeroes, and you need to change them to null values before you look for trends. The code you’re using to do this is returning an error message. But don’t worry! You can ask for help on Stack Overflow.

- How would you write your question?
- Which tags would you use?

Now, write 2–3 sentences (40–60 words) in response to each of these questions. Enter your response in the text box below.
What do you think?
Your answer cannot be more than 10000 characters.

### My Response

- To effectively seek help on Stack Overflow, I would craft a clear and concise question, providing details about the issue I'm facing. I'll include information about the dataset, the specific problem with the code, and any error messages received. Additionally, I'll describe the desired outcome and the steps I've taken so far.
- I would use relevant tags that reflect the tools and technologies involved. In this scenario, appropriate tags might include "BigQuery," "SQL," "Data-Cleaning," and "Weather-Analysis." These tags ensure that my question reaches the right audience with expertise in the specific areas related to my data analysis task.

> A meaningful question would concisely summarize your problem and results. For example, “How can I replace numerical values with NULL in SQL?” You could also include a section of your code and explain that you’re struggling with getting the correct output from your query.  The tags you could use include “compare,” “if-statement,” “SQL,” “subset,” “return-value,” “setvalue,” or “valueerror.”

> As you learn more about SQL in this course (and as you encounter R in the future), Stack Overflow will serve as a valuable resource and help you to succeed. Going forward, seek opportunities to ask questions and find solutions using Stack Overflow. This helpful tool allows you to further your learning and build your data analytics knowledge throughout your career.
