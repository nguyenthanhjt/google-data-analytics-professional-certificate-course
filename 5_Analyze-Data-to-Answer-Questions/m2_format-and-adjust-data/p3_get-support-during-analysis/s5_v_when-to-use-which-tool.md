# Video: When to use which tool

Video transcript

- Hello there.
- In these videos, you've been introduced to spreadsheets, SQL, and so many other tools.
- We've also talked about choosing the right tool before you start a project.
- But sometimes you find yourself stuck on a problem during your data analysis.
- That might mean it's time to reconsider which tool you're using for the job.
- For example, if you're working with a simple spreadsheet, maybe five to ten rows and a few columns, then pivot tables are a great way to visualize that data.
- But if that spreadsheet is more than a million rows, it'll start to crash, making a pivot table hard to complete.
- When you find yourself working with a huge spreadsheet that keeps crashing, you might switch to SQL to pull the data you need from different locations in a database instead of from a single spreadsheet.
- You might remember that SQL can handle trillions of rows of data and is now a standard language for working with database programs.
- SQL is great for querying, updating, and optimizing data.
- But trying to analyze your data with only SQL can get complicated.
- As you continue to progress as a data analyst, you might find yourself spending a lot of time building long, nested queries and then debugging them.
- It might be time to consider another tool, R.
- R is a new tool that you'll work with later on, but for now, I'll tell you a little bit about it so that you can start getting excited.
- R is another programming language, but it's not a database language like SQL.
- It's a programming language frequently used for statistical analysis, visualization, and other data analysis.
- R is a little different from other tools we've been working with, but it's a great complement for the tools you're already using.
- With R, you'll be able to analyze and visualize data in all kinds of new ways.
- We'll talk about R more later on, but I hope this sneak peek gives you an exciting first look.
- Having a variety of tools in your tool kit is important as a data analyst, but just as important is knowing when to use them.
- If you find yourself stuck on a problem, it can be a good idea to take a step back and reconsider how you're approaching a task.
- Do you have too much data for a single spreadsheet? Switch to SQL.
- Are you spending more time debugging queries than actually analyzing data? Maybe you should consider R.
- You also know how to find answers online now.
- So if you ever run into a problem and need to try a different tool, a quick search can be really helpful.
- There might be resources online, or someone else may have had the same problem and posted about it.
- This is great if you start feeling stuck on a problem, and you might even find a new way to use a tool you're already familiar with.
- That brings us to the end of this module.
- Great job.
- We've covered a lot of information.
- We learned about converting and formatting data, how to combine multiple pieces of data, and how to search for help when you need support during your analysis.
- Coming up next, you'll take on the weekly challenge.
- As always, feel free to go back over anything we've learned from these past videos.
- Then I'll see you for the next video.
- Good luck.

## Question

R is a programming language frequently used for what tasks? Select all that apply.

- Statistical analysis
- Protecting data
- Data analysis
- Visualization

> R is a programming language frequently used for data analysis, statistical analysis, and visualization.

## Key Points

- Choosing the Right Tool:
  - The choice of tools depends on the nature and scale of the data analysis project.
  - Consider the size of the dataset and the complexity of the analysis when choosing a tool.
- Tool Selection Examples:
  - For small datasets (5-10 rows, few columns), spreadsheets and pivot tables are effective for visualization.
  - SQL is suitable for handling large datasets with trillions of rows from different database locations.
  - R is introduced as another programming language, specifically used for statistical analysis, visualization, and data analysis.
- Role of SQL:
  - SQL is excellent for querying, updating, and optimizing data.
  - It becomes complex when used solely for analysis, involving long, nested queries and debugging.
- Introduction to R:
  - R is highlighted as a programming language complementing existing tools, offering new ways to analyze and visualize data.
  - It will be explored in more detail later in the program.
- Knowing When to Use Each Tool:
  - The importance of knowing when to use each tool is emphasized.
  - If stuck on a problem, reconsider the approach and switch tools based on the project's requirements.
- Resourceful Problem Solving:
  - Online resources are valuable for finding solutions and exploring new ways to use familiar tools.
  - Searching for answers online is a helpful strategy when facing challenges in data analysis.
- Summary of Covered Topics:
  - The module covered data conversion, formatting, combining multiple datasets, and seeking help during analysis.
  - Learners are encouraged to review the content and prepare for the upcoming weekly challenge.
