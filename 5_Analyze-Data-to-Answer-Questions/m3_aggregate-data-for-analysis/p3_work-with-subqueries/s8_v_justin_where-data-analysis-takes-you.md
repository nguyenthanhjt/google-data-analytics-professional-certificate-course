# Video - Justin: Where data analysis takes you

Video transcript

- Hi, I'm Justin.
- I work here at Google in the Google Cloud space.
- I lead a small team of data analysts who answer business problems for our executive team.
- The first thing I would tell you about my journey to analytics was, it was not direct.
- I came to Google three years ago and I have been doing data analytics and I've really been enjoying that role.
- It's tied together this through line of excitement about data and answering questions that have an impact.
- Your career path is not always straightforward.
- Maybe data analytics won't be my final destination.
- But what I would say is just keep changing little by little, figure out what's exciting about your role right now, in my case, it was, I loved avoiding politics and coalition-building and really just bringing better facts and better insights to really motivate decisions.
- So figure out what you like about your current role, your current job, and then, figure out what different role could you take that would build on that, but maybe get you more of what you like.
- Be curious.
- The number one skill is really just asking why and then going and trying to answer that question.
- It will lead you down along whether it's Wikipedia to understand this model there is someone usually saying, "Why did they use that model?" You go and look up that model and sort of follow that thread.
- Or there's so many great resources for different languages, if you want to understand SQL.
- There's so many great tools, but I guess the number one thing is just sort of follow your curiosity.
- When I'm reviewing resumes, the first thing obviously I'm looking for is those core skills, the ability to analyze data, demonstrate it, experience with some of the tooling we use.
- But I'm also looking for real passion in answering questions.
- Example is where someone's really dug in and tried to understand the why and they just kept asking, "Why is this happening, why is this happening?" and really dig in.
