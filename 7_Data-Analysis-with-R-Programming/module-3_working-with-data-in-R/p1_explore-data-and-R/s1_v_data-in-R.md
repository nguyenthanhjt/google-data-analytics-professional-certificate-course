# Video: Data in R

Video transcript

- Hey, it's great to have you back.
- Now that we've been introduced to R and programmed with it, let's learn about even more ways you can use R during our analysis process.
- We'll start by learning more about data frames and how to use them, and then explore how to work with our data in different ways using tidyverse packages.
- After that, we'll cover how to check for bias in R.
- R's community has really helped me grow as a data analyst, especially when it comes to processes like data cleaning.
- R helps me clean more efficiently and I can turn to a community of folks to learn how they have cleaned similar data.
- Sharing knowledge of R and being able to code review has improved my work a ton.
- I'm so excited to show you new ways to work with R and get more out of your data.
- Earlier, I mentioned that learning R was going to be fun.
- Here's where we get to take what we've learned so far and put it in action.
- When you're ready, you can get started in the next video.
- See you soon.
