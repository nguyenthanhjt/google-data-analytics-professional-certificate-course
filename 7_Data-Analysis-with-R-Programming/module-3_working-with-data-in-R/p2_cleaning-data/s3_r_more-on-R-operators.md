# Reading: More on R operators

You might remember that an **operator** is a symbol that identifies the type of operation or calculation to be performed in a formula. In an earlier video, you learned how to use the assignment and arithmetic operators to assign variables and perform calculations. In this reading, you will review a detailed summary of the main types of operators in R, and learn how to use specific operators in R code.

## Operators

In R, there are four main types of operators:

- Arithmetic
- Relational
- Logical
- Assignment

Review the specific operators in each category and check out some examples of how to use them in R code.

### Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators let you perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

| Operator | Description         | Example Code | Result/ Output |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|
| +        | Addition            | x + y        | [1] 7          |
| -        | Subtraction         | x - y        | [1] -3         |
| *        | Multiplication      | x * y        | [1] 10         |
| /        | Division            | x / y        | [1] 0.4        |
| %%       | Modulus             | y %% x       | [1] 1          |
| %/%      | Integer division    | y%/% x       | [1] 2          |
| ^        | Exponent            | y ^ x        | [1] 25         |

### Relational operators

Relational operators, also known as comparators, allow you to compare values. Relational operators identify how one R object relates to anotherâ€”like whether an object is less than, equal to, or greater than another object. The output for relational operators is either TRUE or FALSE (which is a logical data type, or boolean).

| Operator | Description             | Example Code | Result/Output |
|----------|-------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| <        | Less than               | x < y        | [1] TRUE      |
| >        | Greater than            | x > y        | [1] FALSE     |
| <=       | Less than or equal to   | x <= 2       | [1] TRUE      |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to| y >= 10      | [1] FALSE     |
| ==       | Equal to                | y == 5       | [1] TRUE      |
| !=       | Not equal to            | x != 2       | [1] FALSE     |

### Logical operators

Logical operators allow you to combine logical values. Logical operators return a logical data type or boolean (TRUE or FALSE). You encountered logical operators in an earlier reading, [Logical operators and conditional statements](../../module-2_programming-using-RStudio/p2_explore-coding-in-R/s2_r_logical-operator-n-conditional-statements.md), but here is a quick refresher.

| Operator | Description            |
|----------|------------------------|
| &        | Element-wise logical AND|
| &&       | Logical AND            |
| \|       | Element-wise logical OR|
| \|\|     | Logical OR             |
| !        | Logical NOT            |

### Assignment operators

Assignment operators let you assign values to variables.

| Operator | Description | Example Code (after the sample code below, typing x will generate the output in the next column) | Result/ Output |
|------|----------------------|----------|--------|
| <-   | Leftwards assignment | x <- 2   | [1] 2  |
| <<-  | Leftwards assignment | x <<- 7  | [1] 7  |
| =    | Leftwards assignment | x = 9    | [1] 9  |
| ->   | Rightwards assignment| 11 -> x  | [1] 11 |
| ->>  | Rightwards assignment| 21 ->> x | [1] 21 |

The operators you learned about in this reading are a great foundation for using operators in R.

Check out the article about [R Operators](https://r-coder.com/operators-r/#Assignment_operators_in_R) on the R Coder website for a comprehensive guide to the different types of operators in R. The article includes lots of useful coding examples, and information about miscellaneous operators, the infix operator, and the pipe operator.
