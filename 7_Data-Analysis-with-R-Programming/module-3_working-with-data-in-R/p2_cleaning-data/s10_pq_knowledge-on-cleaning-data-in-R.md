# Practice Quiz: Test your knowledge on cleaning data

## **Question 1**: Data analysts are cleaning their data in R. They want to be sure that their column names are unique and consistent to avoid any errors in their analysis. What R function can they use to do this automatically?

- [ ] clean_names()
- [ ] select()
- [x] rename_with()
- [ ] rename()

> Correct: The clean_names() function will automatically make sure that column names are unique and consistent.

## **Question 2**: You are working with the penguins dataset. You want to use the `arrange()` function to sort the data for the column bill_length_mm in ascending order. You write the following code

   ```r
   penguins %>%
   ```

   Add a single code chunk to sort the column bill_length_mm in ascending order. Note: DO NOT write the above code `penguins %>%` into your answer as it has already been pre-written into the code chunk.

   What is the shortest bill length in mm?

- [ ] 33.1
- [x] 32.1
- [ ] 33.5
- [ ] 34.0

> Correct: You add the code chunk arrange(bill_length_mm) to sort the column bill_length_mm in ascending order. The correct code is penguins %>% arrange(bill_length_mm). Inside the parentheses of the arrange() function is the name of the variable you want to sort. The code returns a tibble that displays the data for bill_length_mm from shortest to longest. The shortest bill length is 32.1mm.

## **Question 3**: Data analysts are working with customer information from their companyâ€™s sales data. The first and last names are in separate columns, but they want to create one column with both names instead. Which of the following functions can they use?

- [ ] select()
- [x] separate()
- [ ] unite()
- [ ] arrange()

> Correct: The unite() function can be used to combine columns.
