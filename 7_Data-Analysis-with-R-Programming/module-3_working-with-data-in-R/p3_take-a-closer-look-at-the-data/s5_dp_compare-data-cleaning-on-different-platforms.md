# Discussion Prompt: Compare data cleaning on different platforms

In the past few Discussion Prompts, you have been comparing R to other data analytics tools. Now, itâ€™s time to consider the similarities and differences of R and spreadsheets for data-cleaning processes.

Write a response of two or more paragraphs (100-150 words total) discussing what you have noticed while cleaning data. Then, visit the [discussion forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-r/discussions)  to review what others have written, and respond to at least two posts with your own thoughts.

## My response

As a beginner with R, I've noticed that getting tidy data involves different approaches compared to spreadsheets. In R, I use packages like `tidyr` and `dplyr` to reshape and clean data. With `tidyr`, functions like `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider` help me convert between wide and long formats efficiently. Additionally, `dplyr` functions like `filter`, `mutate`, and `arrange` allow me to clean and organize data with ease.

In spreadsheets, I often rely on sorting, filtering, and manual adjustments to clean data. While spreadsheets provide a visual interface that's easy to understand, they can become cumbersome for large datasets or complex cleaning tasks. In contrast, R's code-based approach offers more flexibility and reproducibility, making it ideal for handling larger datasets and automating cleaning processes. Overall, both R and spreadsheets have their strengths, but as I continue learning R, I appreciate its power and efficiency in getting data tidy.
