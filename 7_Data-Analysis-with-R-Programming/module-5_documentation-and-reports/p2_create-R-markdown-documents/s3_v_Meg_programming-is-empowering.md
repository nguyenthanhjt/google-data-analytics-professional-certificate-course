# Video: Meg: Programming is empowering

Video transcript

- I'm Meg and I'm a product lead at Google.
- As a product lead, I work with designers and web developers to build features that our users will love.
- Specifically, I work for Kaggle, which is an online data science community for people who are learning data science and machine learning.
- We get to build exciting features that help people learn from data and advance in their careers.
- I work with designers and researchers to do studies to understand what our users want and what they need in the product, and I work with engineers to figure out exactly how to write out those requirements for the features that we decide to build.
- Learning any programming language is really empowering because your only limits are your creativity and your curiosity.
- It's really the curiosity that I have about the world that led me to research and data analysis, especially with R.
- I just felt it was really freeing to be able to ask a question about the world and know how I could work with data to get an answer to that question.
- The second thing that I think is really exciting and empowering about knowing a programming language is the transferable skills that it gives you.
- Then the last thing that I think is really exciting is really the community and ecosystem that comes along with it.
- R is really no exception when it comes to that.
- In fact, I think R's community is really outstanding.
- To have the community and that public ecosystem of resources right at your fingertips is really going to supercharge what you can do with data as a data analyst and I think that's super exciting.
- Its completely normal to feel intimidated or confused or stuck as you're first learning R.
- There are things that are quirky about the language, and it's not your fault.
- You just have to get past those things and I can promise that things will make a lot more sense, especially once you're able to start using the tidyverse.
- I would say stick with it.
- The other piece of advice I'd have is try to connect with the R community as early as possible in your R-learning journey.
- The thing that's just fantastic about R is the fact that its community is really vibrant, it's really welcoming and you're going to find things like people who are expert practitioners in R who are sharing their mistakes and they're willing to share their learning journey as well.
- I think it'll really help you see that you're not alone.
- I definitely had these moments where I was pretty frustrated when I was first learning R.
- When it really clicked for me, was when I had the opportunity to use R to answer my own personal research questions.
- That is when you feel you have a personal vested interest in the outcome of your analysis.
- That feeling of reward and satisfaction when you push through is something that can help really build that momentum to keep learning.
