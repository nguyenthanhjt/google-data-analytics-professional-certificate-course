# Discussion Prompt: Using R Markdown notebooks

With an R Markdown notebook, you can create an interactive R Markdown document that allows users to run your code and explore graphs and charts that visualize that code. Now that you are more familiar with R Markdown, think about how to use it during your own analysis.

What are some of the benefits of using R Markdown notebooks? And are there any projects you have completed that you could have documented using R Markdown notebooks?

Write two paragraphs (150-200 words) discussing the benefits of R Markdown notebooks and how you might use them. Then, visit the [discussion forum] to read what other learners have written, and engage with two or more posts to share your feedback.

## My reply

For data analysts, documentation and reports are very important, so I think the R Markdown notebook is practical for them. We can integrate code, visualization, and explanatory text in a file, making it easier to understand the analysis process and insight results.
For me, as a note fascinator, Markdown is a powerful tool, I always take a note in Markdown every time I work, research, or learn something. With R Markdown, I do not just take notes; I can also put code chunks in and see the output, including interactive visualization. It's so easy when I want to share my work to others
