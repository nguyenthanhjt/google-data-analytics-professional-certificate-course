# Reading: Optional: Jupyter notebooks

![Image](./resources/img-2.png)

Jupyter notebooks are documents that contain computer code and rich text elements – such as comments, links, or descriptions of your analysis and results. You will find them used in a variety of online tools, including Project Jupyter, Kaggle, and Google Colaboratory ("Colab" for short). These notebooks can be executable documents that you can run to perform an analysis.

Jupyter notebooks can come in handy with everything from data cleaning and transformation, to statistical modeling and visualizations. They are compatible with R, so you can consider them as an alternative to R Markdown. And just like R Markdown documents, you can easily share Jupyter notebooks with team members and stakeholders.

## Jupyter notebooks in Kaggle

If you are working in Kaggle, there are two types of notebooks available: Jupyter notebooks and scripts (including R Markdown scripts). For more information, refer to the [How to Use Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks) page.

## Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab

Google Colab is a product from Google Research. Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use.  For more information, refer to the [Welcome to Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) page.

## Additional resources

To learn more about Jupyter notebooks, check out these resources:
