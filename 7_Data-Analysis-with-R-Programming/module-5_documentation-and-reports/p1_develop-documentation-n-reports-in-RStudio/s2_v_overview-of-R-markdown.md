# Video: Overview of R Markdown

Video transcript

- Hi again. As a data analyst, you'll need to refer to your analysis at a moment's notice.
- You might need to share it with your fellow team members or a stakeholder might ask about one of your conclusions.
- Documenting your work makes it easy to quickly share your analysis with anyone, and that's where R Markdown comes in.
- Earlier, we learned that R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R.
- R Markdown lets you create a record of your analysis and conclusions in a document.
- It ties together your code and your report so you can share every step of your analysis.
- The best part is, you don't even have to leave RStudio to do this.
- This document will help stakeholders and team members understand what you did in your analysis to reach your conclusions.
- Their feedback will also help you improve your analysis.
- R Markdown documents are written in Markdown.
- Markdown is a syntax for formatting plain text files.
- Using Markdown makes it easier to write and format text in your document.
- Markdown is also easy to read and to learn.
- For example, if you want to italicize a word or phrase in Markdown, just add a single underscore or asterisk right before and after the word.
- When you create a report of the document, the Markdown formatting is no longer visible, just the word or phrase in italics.
- We'll show you more formatting options soon, but they're all similar to this example.
- Basically, they're simple enough to let you focus on descriptions and explanations of your analysis without having to think too much about how to format them.
- Besides text, R Markdown also includes an interactive option called an R Notebook that lets users run your code and show the graphs and charts that visualize the code.
- Any R Markdown document can be used as a notebook.
- This creates a clear overall picture of your analysis and conclusions.
- R Markdown lets you convert your files into lots of different formats too.
- You can create HTML, PDF, and Word documents, or you can convert to a slide presentation or dashboard.
- Having these options makes it easy to share the same analysis in a variety of ways, depending on your audience.
- The Markdown language was originally designed for HTML output.
- HTML is the set of markup symbols and codes used to create a web page.
- R Markdown has the most available features for this format, but you can get good results in any of the formats.
- While R Markdown is a great way to record and share your analysis, there are other options too.
- Notebooks like Jupyter, Kaggle, and Google Colab do a lot of the same things as an R Markdown notebook, including the interactive elements.
- You'll read more about these options in a little bit.
- Coming up, we'll create an R Markdown document.
- You'll get to see this effective analysis tool in action.
- See you soon.
