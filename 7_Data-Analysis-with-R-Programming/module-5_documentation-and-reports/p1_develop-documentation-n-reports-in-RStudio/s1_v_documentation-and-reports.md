# Video: Documentation and reports

Video transcript

- Hi, and welcome back.
- We've covered a lot in our time working in R.
- We've learned the ins and outs of R and RStudio including how to analyze and visualize your data.
- Now, you'll learn how to document and report your work using R Markdown.
- R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R.
- You can use an R Markdown file as a code notebook to save, organize, and document your analysis using code chunks, comments, and other features.
- When you finish your data cleaning and exploration, you can create a report in R Markdown to summarize your findings for stakeholders.
- The core of the work we do in my department involves analytics.
- When my team started getting bigger, we noticed we didn't have a shared language for data analysis.
- So, there was an effort for everyone to learn R so we could collaborate more easily.
- Now, everyone speaks the same programming language.
- We can review each other's code, which has led to more consistency and collaboration and better analysis.
- R Markdown reports are great for sharing knowledge.
- These reports let anyone from a small group of online users to a large company share and reproduce analysis.
- In this course, we'll start with an overview of R Markdown, and then we'll learn how to install R Markdown in RStudio.
- After that, we'll check out how to create an R Markdown document.
- We'll also explore the structure and components of the document, so you'll have an idea of how to use them to record and report your analysis.
- Next, we'll show you how to insert and edit pieces of code called chunks into your document.
- Finally, we'll check out the process of exporting your documentation.
- It's always good to have a report of the analysis you've done, both for yourself and your stakeholders.
- After that, we'll wrap up our time with R.
- Of course, your time with R can keep going and you can keep practicing.
- I hope you'll put R to good use in your future job as a data analyst too.
- It's a huge advantage in your career.
- Speaking of your career, when you've completed everything in our program, you'll have the chance to add to or start building your portfolio by completing a case study.
- This is a great way to showcase all the skills you've learned so far, and stand out to future employers.
- We'll talk more about this project later.
- In the meantime, let's get back into the R groove.
- See you soon.

## Notes

- **R Markdown**: a file format for making dynamic documents with R

## My wrapped keypoints

1. **Introduction to R Markdown**: R Markdown is a file format used for creating dynamic documents with R. It allows users to integrate code, text, and visualizations in a single document, making it ideal for documenting and reporting data analysis workflows.

2. **Purpose of R Markdown**: R Markdown serves as a code notebook where users can save, organize, and document their analysis using code chunks, comments, and other features. It enables users to summarize their findings and share their analysis with stakeholders effectively.

3. **Benefits of Using R Markdown**
   - Facilitates collaboration: Teams can collaborate more easily by sharing R Markdown documents, allowing members to review each other's code and ensure consistency in analysis.
   - Knowledge sharing: R Markdown reports enable sharing and reproducing analysis, making it accessible to a wide range of users, from small groups to large companies.

4. **Course Overview**: The course will cover the following topics:
   - Overview of R Markdown
   - Installation of R Markdown in RStudio
   - Creating an R Markdown document
   - Exploring the structure and components of the document
   - Inserting and editing code chunks
   - Exporting documentation

5. **Importance of Documentation**: Having a report of the analysis done in R Markdown is beneficial for both the analyst and stakeholders. It provides a comprehensive record of the analysis process, making it easier to understand and reproduce the results.

6. **Career Advantages**: Proficiency in R and R Markdown is a valuable skill for data analysts, providing a competitive advantage in the job market. Completing the program and the case study project offers an opportunity to build a portfolio and showcase skills to potential employers.
