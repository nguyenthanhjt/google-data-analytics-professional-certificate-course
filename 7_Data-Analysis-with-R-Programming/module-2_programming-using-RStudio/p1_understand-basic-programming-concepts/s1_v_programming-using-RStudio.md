# Video: Programming using RStudio

Video transcript

- Hi and welcome back.
- We've given you a big-picture overview of R and RStudio.
- Now we'll turn our focus to the actual programming and coding you'll do using RStudio.
- I went pretty far in my career not knowing programming before it became clear, I needed to learn it.
- Getting to know R was such a valuable learning experience.
- It took some time, and I reached out to more-experienced R users with lots of questions.
- Eventually, it all came together for me.
- Being open to learning new skills is such an important part of your career.
- Now I'm able to help you learn some new skills too.
- I'll start by sharing the fundamentals of programming using R in RStudio.
- Earlier, we explained how R is like the engine of a car and RStudio is like the accelerator, steering wheel, and dashboard all in one.
- Getting to know fundamentals will help you keep your R car running smoothly.
- These fundamentals are both alike and different from the other analysis platforms you've come to know well: spreadsheets and SQL.
- Then we'll move on to coding in RStudio.
- We'll discuss the syntax for performing calculations and the standards and naming conventions for all code.
- We'll also explore the R tool known as a pipe, which you'll use to make a sequence of code easier to work with and read.
- Then we'll check out R packages.
- While these packages won't be delivered to your door, they are delivered by the R community.
- These packages contain reusable functions and more, and are usually built by users for users like yourself.
- We'll get to know a collection of packages called the Tidyverse.
- You'll learn how to install the Tidyverse so you can start using it in RStudio.
- We'll also work with some of the more popular Tidyverse packages like ggplot2 for visualization.
- You'll be able to carry over what you've learned about RStudio to the next part of the program, where you'll start working with data.
- As we explained earlier, for this program, we'll use the in-browser version of RStudio: RStudio Cloud.
- But RStudio is also available to be downloaded.
- So let's get going.
- See you soon.

## Key points covered in the video include

1. The value of learning programming, especially in R, for data analysis.
2. The analogy of R being the engine and RStudio being the controls of a car.
3. The importance of being open to learning new skills.
4. Introduction to the fundamentals of programming in RStudio, including syntax, standards, and naming conventions.
5. Overview of the pipe operator, a tool used to simplify code sequences.
6. Explanation of R packages, which contain reusable functions and are built by the R community.
7. Introduction to the Tidyverse, a collection of R packages with a common design philosophy for data manipulation and visualization.
8. Installation of the Tidyverse in RStudio.
9. Brief mention of using RStudio Cloud for the program, with the option to download RStudio for offline use.
