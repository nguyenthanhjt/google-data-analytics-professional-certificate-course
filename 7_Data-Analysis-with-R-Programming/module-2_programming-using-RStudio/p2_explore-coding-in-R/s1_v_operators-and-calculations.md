# Video: Operators and calculations

## Questions & Notes

- **Operator**: a symbol that names the type of operation or calculation to be performed in a formula
- **Assignment Operator** operators: used to assign values to variables and vectors
- **Arithmetic operators**: used to complete math calculations
  - `+`:addition
  - `-`:subtraction
  - `*`:multplication
  - `/`:division

**Note**: At closer glance, you will notice that the instructor highlighted the entire 4 lines of syntax together before running the code by pressing the "Run" button or pressing the hotkeys (PC : CTRL + Enter and Mac: CMND + Enter) .

As an alternative option, you may separately run each line of code one at a time after typing the syntax. Follow these steps in the script editor:

```r
# our first calculations (run the code)

quarter_1_sales <- 35657.98 (run the code)

quarter_2_sales <- 43810.55 (run the code)

midyear_sales <- quarter_1_sales + quarter_2_sales (run the code)****

```

Each variable will be committed to memory in the script editor before getting to the next line, so you won't receive an error when running the final line of code containing the midyear_sales variable.

### Question 1: A data analyst inputs the following calculation in their R programming: `basket_1 * 20 + basket_2 * 15` Which arithmetic operators is the analyst using? Select all that apply

- [ ] Division
- [x] `Multiplication`
- [ ] Subtraction
- [x] `Addition`

> In the calculation `basket_1 * 20 + basket_2 * 15`, the analyst is performing arithmetic operations for addition using the addition operator (+) and for multiplication using the multiplication operator (*)
