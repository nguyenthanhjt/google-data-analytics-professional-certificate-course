# Queries and programming

Now that you have written queries using SQL and used code to program in R, you may have noticed some similarities between the two. Submit a response of two or more paragraphs (100-150 words total) discussing any similarities you may have come across. Then, visit the 
[discussion forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-r/discussions) to review what others have written, and respond to at least two posts with your own thoughts.
