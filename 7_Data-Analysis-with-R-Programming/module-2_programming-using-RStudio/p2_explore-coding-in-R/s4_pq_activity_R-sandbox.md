# Practice Quiz: Hands-On Activity: R sandbox

## **Activity overview**

So far, you’ve learned about the R programming language and why data analysts use it. In this activity, you will preview some of the cool things you can do in R. You will also learn more about working with packages and data and try out some important functions.

By the end of this activity, you will know how to install and load R packages, practice using functions to view, clean, and visualize data, and learn more about using R markdown to document your analysis. This will enable you to use R markdown, which helps to facilitate collaboration and document analysis which is needed for more complex projects.

## **Work in RStudio Cloud**

To start, log into your RStudio (Posit) Cloud account. Open the project you will work on in the activity with [this link](https://posit.cloud/content/6208304). At the top right portion of the screen you will see a "red stamp" indicating this project as a Temporary Copy. Click on the adjacent button, Save a Permanent Copy, and the project will be saved in your main dashboard for use with future lessons. Once that is completed, navigate to the file explorer in the bottom right and click the following: Course 7 -> Week 2 -> Lesson3_Sandbox.Rmd.

If you’re having trouble finding the correct activity, check out this [step-by-step guide](https://scribehow.com/shared/Access_and_Install_Course_Material_for_Lesson_3__JGhlL8PLSxuqtK2KRWZkJw) on how to navigate in RStudio (Posit) Cloud. Make sure to select the correct R markdown (Rmd) file. The other Rmd files will be used in different activities.

If you are using RStudio Desktop, you can download the Rmd file directly [here](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/k7wCfkohTdG8An5KIU3R_g_c39319760e5344c1916586dbc1594af1_Lesson3_Sandbox.Rmd?Expires=1710979200&Signature=VbIqQOUsHiDP-9VtAGv~tRgCsZgONFGBh2IFlxhgf6BVr2bhZoBfwpiy~O5mHrp9LDaQNw0PfICld50trVub~JDDGROLgp0aFJHA7sbii5qUzTOSXun6kmZC-XCc5EDCzWFsxUh4hv-0keJ2WC~sshTFiZ6GTO1Bf56pic0ZUYs_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A) OR [this markdown file](./resources/s3_sandbox.md).

Carefully read the instructions in the comments of the Rmd file and complete each step. Some steps may be as simple as running pre-written code, while others may require you to write your own functions. After you finish the steps in the Rmd file, return here to confirm that your work is complete.
