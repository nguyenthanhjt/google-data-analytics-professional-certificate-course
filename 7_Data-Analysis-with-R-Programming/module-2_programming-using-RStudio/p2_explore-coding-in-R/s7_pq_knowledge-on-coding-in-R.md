# Practice Quiz: Test your knowledge on coding in R

## Question 1: An analyst includes the following calculation in their R programming:

```R
midyear_sales <- (quarter_1_sales + quarter_2_sales) - overhead_costs
```

Which variable will the total from this calculation be assigned to?

- [x] midyear_sales
- [ ] quarter_1_sales
- [ ] quarter_2_sales
- [ ] overhead_costs

> Correct: The total from this calculation will be assigned to the variable midyear_sales. The assignment operator <- follows the variable mid_sales, so the value of the calculated total is assigned to this variable.

## Question 2: An analyst is checking the value of the variable x using a logical operator, so they run the following code:

```R
x > 35 & x < 65
```

Which values of x would return TRUE when the analyst runs the code? Select all that apply.

- [ ] 35
- [x] 50
- [x] 60
- [ ] 70

> Correct: The values 50 and 60 will return TRUE when the analyst runs the code x > 35 & x < 65. In this code, the logical operator & tells the server to return TRUE when the value of the variable is greater than 35 and less than 65.

## Question 3: A data analyst inputs the following code in RStudio

```R
sales_1 <- 100 * sales_2
```

Which of the following types of operators does the analyst use in the code? Select all the apply.

- [x ] assignment
- [ ] logical
- [x] arithmetic
- [ ] relational

> Correct: The analyst uses assignment and arithmetic operators in the code. The assignment operator (<-) assigns the variable sales_1 to the value of 100 * sales_2. The multiplication operator (*) multiplies 100 by sales_2.
