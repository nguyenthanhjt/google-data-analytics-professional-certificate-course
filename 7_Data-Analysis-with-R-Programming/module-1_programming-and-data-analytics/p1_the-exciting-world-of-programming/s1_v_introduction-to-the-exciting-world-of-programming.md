# Video: Introduction to the exciting world of programming

Video transcript

- Hey there, data pro.
- You've come a long way since the beginning of your learning journey.
- Congratulations on your accomplishment.
- Just think of all the skills you've learned along the way.
- You now know how to use structured thinking to define a problem and ask the right questions; work with spreadsheets, databases, and tools like SQL to organize and transform data; clean your data to make sure it has integrity before you analyze it; create impactful visuals to illustrate key points; and craft a compelling story to communicate insights to stakeholders.
- That's an impressive list of skills, but we're not done yet.
- Your skills set's about to get even bigger.
- In this course, you'll learn about a new concept called programming and how you can use the R programming language to analyze your data.
- By now, you know that the data analysis process includes six phases: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
- Now, we'll learn all about the R programming language and how it can help you in each phase of the process.
- When you're done, you'll be presented with an optional case study.
- The case study will give you the chance to solve a data analysis problem using all the skills you've learned in this program.
- You'll find out more about this project later on.
- Let's talk about computer programming.
- Computer programming refers to giving instructions to a computer to perform an action or set of actions.
- You can use different programming languages to write these instructions.
- You might choose a specific language based on the project you want to pursue or the problem you want to solve.
- The R programming language is super useful for organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data.
- If this is your first experience with computer programming, welcome.
- When I first started learning about data analysis, I didn't have a background in programming either.
- In fact, before I fell in love with data, I was trained as an opera singer.
- I also have a lot of friends that came into this field from the arts and learned about programming later in their career.
- R is a great place to start.
- Learning R for the first time can be challenging and even more empowering.
- A lot of the skills you've learned in this program will help you learn basic programming concepts.
- Take it one step at a time and go at your own pace.
- Just like in previous videos, you'll start with the basics and move forward from there.
- You've tackled tough challenges before and you always come out on top.
- You've got this.
- Let me introduce myself.
- My name's Carrie.
- I work as a research manager at Google.
- I lead a team that researches the best way to improve the performance of people in organizations.
- In other words, I help people work better and work smarter and help organizations function in a healthy and productive way.
- I first learned R as a junior data analyst, while I was working on a multi-year project about virtual work.
- We were looking at data on people's virtual work experiences and trying to understand how working remotely impacts performance.
- It was a complex project with a lot of data to sift through.
- I kept encountering problems and searching for better and faster ways to do things.
- This is when I became aware of the power of R.
- Whenever I got stuck, I'd learn a little more about R and discover a solution to my problem.
- I soon realized that R could help me do almost anything involving data even better and faster than I thought possible.
- Fortunately, there are tons of great online resources for R and a super supportive online community.
- If I had a question, I'd go online and find the answer.
- As the project progressed, I was able to learn more and more and become a much more effective data analyst.
- My teammates even started coming to me for advice about R.
- Realizing that I could continue to learn my skills at any stage in my career was an empowering experience.
- Learning R unlocked my ability to perform data analysis at the highest level.
- In your future career as a data analyst, you'll have the opportunity to continually learn and grow.
- To me, that might be one of the coolest aspects of the job.
- Learning R is one of the most rewarding parts of that growth process.
- I'm still learning new ways to use R all the time.
- Plus, you can apply these skills to other programming languages like Python, Julia, or JavaScript.
- There's no limit to how far you can go with programming.
- It even goes beyond data analysis.
- After I learned R, I found myself thinking about all kinds of projects I could use programming for, both at work and for fun.
- It opens up a whole new world of possibilities.
- Now, let's talk about what you're about to learn.
- We'll start off with an introduction to programming languages.
- Then we'll take a closer look at R itself and explore its main features and functions.
- We'll also cover some basic programming concepts and learn how to use them effectively in R.
- Next, we'll learn how to work with data in R.
- You'll discover how R can supercharge your data analysis skills and let you clean, transform, visualize, and report data in new and more powerful ways.
- Learning R will help you take your data analysis to the next level.
- It'll also look great on your resume.
- R is widely recognized as a key credential in entry- level job positions.
- Knowing how to use R will give you a big boost in your job hunt and will help you stand out as a new analyst.
- Coming up, we'll talk more about programming languages in general and how they can help you analyze your data.
- After that, we'll jump right into R.
- Before you know it, you'll be using R to power your data analysis.
