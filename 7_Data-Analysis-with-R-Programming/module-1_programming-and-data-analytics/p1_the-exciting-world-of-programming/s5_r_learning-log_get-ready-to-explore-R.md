# Learning Log: Get ready to explore R

## **Overview:**

So far, you’ve learned about data management, analysis, and visualization. In this upcoming course, you will learn the fundamentals of R and how it can be used to perform the same data analysis steps you already know. Now, you’ll complete an entry in your learning log considering R as a tool for data analysis. By the time you complete this entry, you will be ready to start learning this new and exciting tool!

## *R you ready?*

Before you start writing your learning log entry in the template linked below, let’s discuss what exactly R is. R is a programming language used for statistical analysis, visualization, and other data analysis. As a data analyst, you will use R to complete many of the tasks associated with the data analysis process. Understanding how it works and why you use it is crucial to developing a mastery of data analytics.

Like the other tools you have already learned in this program, R will be an important part of your data analysis toolkit. You don’t need any previous experience with R for this course; you’ll get a chance to learn the basics and practice writing R code yourself. Then, you can even try using R for your capstone project later!

In the learning log template below, you’ll get a chance to reflect on learning R and what you’re most excited about for this course.

## **Reflection**

Take a moment to reflect on learning about R. In your learning log template, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each question below:

1. *Which parts of R are you excited to learn about?*

2. *Which parts seem most challenging?*

When you’ve finished your entry in the learning log template, make sure to save the document so your response is somewhere accessible. This will help you continue applying data analysis to your everyday life. You will also be able to track your progress and growth as a data analyst.

### My Response

1. *What made you decide to learn about R?*

- I decided to learn about R because I see it as a powerful tool for data analysis, particularly in statistical analysis and visualization. I want to expand my skills beyond the tools I currently use and explore new ways to analyze and interpret data effectively.
- I decided to learn about R because it's widely used in the field of data analysis and offers powerful capabilities for statistical analysis and visualization. Mastering R will expand my toolkit and enhance my proficiency as a data analyst.

1. *Which parts of R are you excited to learn about? Which parts might seem difficult?*

- I'm excited to learn about R's capabilities in data visualization and its extensive library of statistical functions. However, I anticipate that mastering the syntax and understanding how to efficiently manipulate data using R might pose some challenges initially. Nonetheless, I'm eager to overcome these obstacles and become proficient in using R for data analysis
- I'm excited to delve into R's data manipulation and visualization features, as well as its extensive library of packages for various analytical tasks. However, I anticipate that understanding R's syntax and programming concepts might initially pose a challenge, especially as I transition from using spreadsheet-based tools to writing code.
