# Video: Introduction to R

Video transcript

- Hello again.
- Now that we've talked about programming languages in general, let's get to know R.
- So what is R? R is a programming language frequently used for statistical analysis, visualization and other data analysis.
- Later on, you'll take a tour of Rstudio, which is a popular software environment for the R language.
- In this video, we'll discuss R's main features and functions and its advantages for data analysis.
- R is super cool.
- I'm excited for you to learn about it.
- R is based on another programming language named S.
- In the 1970s, John Chambers created S for internal use at Bell Labs, a famous scientific research facility.
- In the 1990s, Ross Oaxaca and Robert Gentleman developed R at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.
- The title R refers to the first names of its two authors and plays on a single- letter title of its predecessor S.
- Since then, R has become a preferred programming language of scientists, statisticians and data analysts around the world.
- There's lots of reasons why people who work with data love R.
- I want to share four with you.
- R is accessible, data-centric, open-source and has an active community of users.
- First R is an accessible language for beginners.
- Lots of people without a traditional programming language learn R.
- I should know.
- I'm one of them.
- R really appeals to anyone who wants to solve problems that involve data.
- And that's one of the things that's so great about R.
- It's all about data.
- R is what's known as a data-centric programming language.
- It's specifically designed to make data analysis easier, more efficient and more powerful.
- Another awesome thing about R is that it's open source.
- Open source means that the code is freely available and may be modified and shared by the people who use it.
- Let's pause for a moment and unpack how amazing this is.
- First anyone can use R for free.
- Second, anyone can modify the code, fix bugs and improve it.
- In fact, over the years, lots of excellent programmers have made improvements and fixes to the R code.
- For example, anyone who knows the R language can create what's called an add-on package.
- We'll talk more about R packages later.
- For now, just know that literally thousands of R packages exist, and they were all built by people who wanted to solve specific problems.
- A lot of these packages are super useful for data analysts.
- As an R user, you now enjoy the benefit of the shared knowledge.
- And let me just add, the R community is the best.
- This vibrant, diverse and accessible community is so supportive of new learners.
- You can go online anytime to find answers to all your R questions.
- Check out websites like R for Data Science Online Learning Community and RStudio Community.
- On top of that, R users are all over Twitter and other social media.
- You'll discover tons of resources for professional networking, mentoring and learning.
- Now that we know more about the general benefits of R, let's talk about some specific situations when you might use it for data analysis.
- Here's three scenarios: reproducing your analysis, processing lots of data, and creating data visualizations.
- First R can save and reproduce every step of your analysis.
- Earlier, we discussed how data analysis is most useful when you can easily reproduce your work and share it with others.
- In R, reproducing your analysis is as easy as pressing a button on your keyboard.
- Your code stores it forever.
- And you can share it with anyone at any time.
- Processing lots of data is also something R does really well, just like SQL.
- As you learned earlier spreadsheets organize projects in sheets or tabs.
- If you've ever had to deal with spreadsheet files that have tons of sheets or lots of data in each sheet, you know that things can start to move very slowly.
- Working with too much data in a spreadsheet can even cause crashes.
- R can handle large amounts of data much more quickly and efficiently.
- Finally R can create powerful visuals and has state-of-the-art graphic capabilities.
- As you've seen in this program, tools like spreadsheets and Tableau offer lots of options for visualizing your data.
- R's on another level.
- With only a small bit of code, you can create histograms, scatter plots, line plots and so much more.
- And that's just the beginning.
- If you work with more advanced packages, you can make some seriously impressive data visualizations.
- Learning R is a huge benefit to anyone interested in becoming a data analyst.
- As I mentioned earlier, knowledge of R will help you stand out as a job candidate.
- And as you keep moving forward, R will help you find solutions for more complex data problems.
- You can keep learning about R throughout your career as a data analyst.
- The sky's the limit when it comes to developing your data analysis skills.
- That's all for now.
- Coming up, we'll check out the RStudio environment together.
- Before you use RStudio, you need to download and install the basic R interface.
- You'll learn how to do that in an upcoming reading.
- Most analysts who work with the R language use the RStudio environment to interact with R, and not the basic interface.
- That's why we're focusing on RStudio in this program.
- Following this video, you'll find resources for downloading R and RStudio if you're interested in learning more.
- Bye for now.
